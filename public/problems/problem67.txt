Let's call a positive integer MM a beautiful number if the following conditions are satisfied:

The decimal representation of MM (without leading zeros) does not contain any zeros.
The sum of squares of all decimal digits of MM is a perfect square.

For example, 11, 44 and 221221 are beautiful, but 1010 and 333333 are not.

You are given a positive integer NN. Find the smallest NN-digit beautiful number or determine that all NN-digit integers are not beautiful.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the smallest NN-digit beautiful number, or −1−1 if there is no such number.

Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
1≤N≤1061≤N≤106
the sum of NN over all test cases does not exceed 106106

34

Explanation

Example case 1: It is obvious that 11 is the smallest beautiful number.

Example case 2: 3434 is beautiful because 32+42=9+16=25=5232+42=9+16=25=52. On the other hand, we can prove that this is the smallest beautiful number.

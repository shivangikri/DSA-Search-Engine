For a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,…,AKA1,A2,…,AK, let's define the number of inversions in it as the number of pairs of integers (i,j)(i,j) such that 1≤i<j≤K1≤i<j≤K and Ai>AjAi>Aj.

You are given a permutation P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN of the integers 11 through NN. Determine if it is possible to partition this permutation into two subsequences (possibly empty or non-contiguous) such that:

Each element of PP appears in exactly one of these subsequences.
The numbers of inversions in one subsequence is equal to the number of inversions in the other subsequence.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers P1,P2,…,PNP1,P2,…,PN.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to partition the permutation in a given way or "NO" if it is impossible.

Explanation

Example case 1: We can split (1)(1) into (1)(1) and ()(). There are 00 inversions in each of these sequences.

Example case 3: We can split (4,3,2,1)(4,3,2,1) into (4,3)(4,3) and (2,1)(2,1). There is 11 inversion in each of them. Note that this is not the only solution ? we could also split the permutation into sequences (4,1)(4,1) and (3,2)(3,2).

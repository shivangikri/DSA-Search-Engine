A number is said to be a palindrome if it remains the same when it is read backwards. Eg. 1202112021 is pallindrome while 2121 is not A number is called total-palindromic if it contains a palindrome with odd length greater than 11 and an even palindrome as a substring.

For example, the number 2267622676 is total-palindromic whereas the number 101101 is not because it contains the palindrome of odd length 676676 and even length 2222. While 101101 does not contain an even palindrome as a substring.

You are given two numbers aa, bb. Output the number of total-palindromic numbers which lie in the range (a,b](a,b] i.e set {a+1,a+2,....b}{a+1,a+2,....b}

Input

First line contains number of test cases TT. Each test case contains two lines.
First line contains the number aa
Second line contains the number bb

Output

Output TT lines, each line containing an integer - the answer to the test case.

Constraints

1≤T≤1001≤T≤100
99≤a<b≤101899≤a<b≤1018

Sample Input:

110
119

Sample Output:

0
1

Explanation

In second test case the range is between 110110 and 119119 i.e the numbers 111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119. Of these only 111111 contains the odd palindromic substring 111 and even palindromic substring 1111.

So the answer to this test-case is 11.

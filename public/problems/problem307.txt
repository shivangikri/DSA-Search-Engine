You are given a N×MN×M matrix AA, filled with distinct numbers. You can start at any cell. If you are currently at cell (x1,y1)(x1,y1), then you can jump to any other cell (x2,y2)(x2,y2), if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied:

Ax2,y2>Ax1,y1Ax2,y2>Ax1,y1
Manhattan distance between Ax2,y2Ax2,y2 and Ax1,y1Ax1,y1 >S>S. Formally, |x1−x2|+|y1−y2|>S|x1−x2|+|y1−y2|>S.

Let VV be the set of the cells visited by you.

Maximize the value of ∑(x,y)∈V Ax,y∑(x,y)∈V Ax,y.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains the number TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers N,M,SN,M,S - the parameters defined in the statement.
Then NN lines follow, with MM integers in each line.
Each of the next NN lines contains MM integers, where the jj-th integer in ii-th line is equal to Ai,jAi,j

Output Format

For each testcase output the maximum possible value of ∑(x,y)∈V Ax,y∑(x,y)∈V Ax,y.

Explanation

Test case-1: It is optimal start at cell (1,1)(1,1), then jump to cell (3,2)(3,2). Therefore answer is A1,1+A3,2=1+8=9A1,1+A3,2=1+8=9.

Test case-2: It is optimal to start at (2,2)(2,2) and follow this path: (2,2)→(2,1)→(1,2)→(1,1)(2,2)→(2,1)→(1,2)→(1,1). Therefore answer is the sum of all the four cells =394=394.

NN integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN are placed in a circle in such a way that for each valid ii, AiAi and Ai+1Ai+1 are adjacent, and A1A1 and ANAN are also adjacent.

We want to repeat the following operation exactly N−1N−1 times (until only one number remains):

Select two adjacent numbers. Let's denote them by aa and bb.
Score a+ba+b penalty points.
Erase both aa and bb from the circle and insert a+ba+b in the space between them.

What is the minimum number of penalty points we can score?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of penalty points.

Explanation

[10,10,1]→[10,11][10,10,1]→[10,11], penalty:  1111
[10,11]→[21][10,11]→[21], penalty:  2121
Total penalty: 11+21=3211+21=32

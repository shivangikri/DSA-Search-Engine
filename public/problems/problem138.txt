The mayor of Townsville City wants to build a telephone network in the city.
The city is represented as a square grid of size NN x NN. Rows and columns of the grid are numbered from 11 to NN. Each cell of the grid (i,j)(i,j) has a tower of height Hi,jHi,j. The height of each tower is between 11 and KK (inclusive). It is guaranteed that there is at least one tower of each height in the city.

The mayor's engineering team wants to use exactly K−1K−1 cables to create the network.
The first cable should be between a tower of height 11 and a tower of height 22, the second cable should be between a tower of height 22 and a tower of height 33, and so on with the (K−1)th(K−1)th cable connecting a tower of height (K−1)(K−1) and a tower of height KK, i.e., a chain of cables needs to be created in the height order 1,2,3,...,K1,2,3,...,K.
The cost of connecting two cells (i1,j1)(i1,j1) and (i2,j2)(i2,j2) is |i2−i1|+|j2−j1||i2−i1|+|j2−j1|.
For all ii such that 1≤i<K1≤i<K, the ithith and (i+1)th(i+1)th cables should have one tower in common.

Find the minimum total cost of the chain of cables required to build the telephone network.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains 22 space-separated integers NN and KK.
NN lines follow. Each line contains NN space-separated integers. The jthjth number in the ithith line represents Hi,jHi,j.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing the minimum cost of cables used.

1 1 1
2 2 2
3 3 3

Example Output

2

Explanation

Example case 1:

One of the chains that can be formed with minimum cost is (1,1)(1,1) -> (2,1)(2,1) -> (3,1)(3,1) with cost 22.
Even though (1,2)(1,2) -> (2,3)(2,3) -> (3,1)(3,1) is also a valid chain (among other valid chains), it's cost is 55 which is not the minimum.

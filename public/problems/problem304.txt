You are given NN intervals [L1,R1],[L2,R2],…,[LN,RN][L1,R1],[L2,R2],…,[LN,RN]. Consider NN integers x1,x2,…,xNx1,x2,…,xN such that:

xi∈[Li,Ri]xi∈[Li,Ri] for each valid ii
all decimal digits of S=x1+x2+x3+…+xNS=x1+x2+x3+…+xN (without leading zeroes) lie between AA and BB inclusive

In how many different ways can you pick the sequence x1,x2,…,xNx1,x2,…,xN? Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, AA and BB.
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers LiLi and RiRi.

Output

For each test case, print a single line contains one integer — the number of ways to choose x1,x2,…,xNx1,x2,…,xN, modulo 109+7109+7.

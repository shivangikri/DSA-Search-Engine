You are given two integers NN and KK, and an array AA of NN integers. You have to choose KK disjoint non-empty subarrays such that the score is maximized.

The score is calculated as follows:
Score=∑i=1KSum[i]⋅i,Score=∑i=1KSum[i]⋅i,

where Sum[i]Sum[i] denotes sum of elements of ii-th subarray. By the ii-th subarray, we mean the ii-th one in the order from left to right.

Find the maximum score that can be achieved.

Note: The subarrays are not required to cover the whole array. It is allowed for some elements of AA to belong to none of the subarrays.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and KK.
The second line of each test case contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the maximum score.

Explanation

Test Case 1: One way to choose 22 disjoint non-empty subarrays is:

S1=[1,2]S1=[1,2] and S2=[3,1]S2=[3,1]

The score is 3⋅1+4⋅2=113⋅1+4⋅2=11, which is the maximum possible.

Test Case 2: One way to choose 22 disjoint non-empty subarrays is:

S1=[2,11]S1=[2,11] and S2=[12]S2=[12]

The score is 13⋅1+12⋅2=3713⋅1+12⋅2=37, which is the maximum possible.

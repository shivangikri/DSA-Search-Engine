Chozi is, as usual, late for his class and is stuck on a staircase where he is being very skeptic about taking them since some of the stairs are wet and Chozi is wearing very slippery shoes.

There are N stairs, numbered 11 to NN, out of which KK stairs are wet and the class is at the end of the NN - th stair. Chozi can skip 11 or 22 stairs if needed to avoid a wet stair, i.e. if Chozi is on the ii-th stair, he can go to i+1i+1-th ,i+2i+2-th ,i+3i+3 - th stair.

Chozi is not a very punctual student and won't mind skipping a lecture if he cannot avoid all the wet stairs. Help him find the total number of ways in which he can reach the NN-th  stair by avoiding all the wet stairs if he only moves forward.

Find this number of possible ways modulo 109+7109+7.

Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers NN and KK.
The second line contains KK space-separated integers K1K1,K2K2,…,KKKK where each integer denotes the stair number that is wet.

Output:

For each test case, print a single line. The total ways to reach the NN-th stair modulo 109+7109+7.

Constraints

1≤T≤101≤T≤10
3≤N≤1063≤N≤106
0≤K≤N/20≤K≤N/2
1≤Ki<N1≤Ki<N

Sample Input:

1
6 2

2 4

Sample Output:

4

EXPLANATION:

The possible ways are:
[1,3,5,6],[3,5,6],[3,6]and[1,3,6][1,3,5,6],[3,5,6],[3,6]and[1,3,6]. Hence the answer is 4.

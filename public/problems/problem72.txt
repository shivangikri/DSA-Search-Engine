There are NN buckets numbered 11 through NN. The buckets contain balls; each ball has a color between 11 and KK. Let's denote the number of balls with color jj that are initially in bucket ii by ai,jai,j.

For each ii from 11 to N−1N−1 (in this order), someone draws a ball uniformly at random from bucket ii and puts it into bucket i+1i+1, then continues to draw the next ball. After putting a ball in bucket NN, this person draws a ball, again uniformly at random, from bucket NN.

For each color from 11 to KK, find the probability that the ball drawn from bucket NN has this color.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and KK. 
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains KK space-separated integers ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,Kai,1,ai,2,…,ai,K.

Output

Print a single line containing KK space-separated real numbers. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these numbers should denote the probability that the last drawn ball has color ii. your answer will be considered correct if absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−610−6

You are given three integers NN, KK and XX. Is it possible to find a sequence of non-negative integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN such that the number of pairs of indices (i,j)(i,j) (1≤i≤j≤N1≤i≤j≤N) satisfying Ai⊕Aj=XAi⊕Aj=X is equal to KK? Here, ⊕⊕ is the bitwise XOR operator.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, KK and XX.

Output

For each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to find a sequence satisfying the given condition or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).

Explanation

Example case 1: For example, A=[2,2,1,2]A=[2,2,1,2] satisfies the given condition, since there are exactly 33 pairs (i,j)(i,j) such that Ai⊕Aj=3Ai⊕Aj=3.

Example case 3: For example, A=[8,12,3,14,8,15,10,10,8,14]A=[8,12,3,14,8,15,10,10,8,14] satisfies the given condition, since there are exactly 88 pairs with XOR equal to 22.

Chef has a sequence A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN. The sequence is circular, i.e. for each valid ii, elements AiAi and Ai+1Ai+1 are considered adjacent, and elements A1A1 and ANAN are also considered adjacent. Initially, each element of this sequence is either 11 or 00.

You may perform some operations on this sequence. In one operation, you should choose an index ii such that Ai=1Ai=1 and move that 11 to one of its adjacent elements, i.e. change AiAi to 00, choose one of the elements adjacent to AiAi and increment it by 11.

According to Chef, a sequence is good if all its elements are different from 11. You have to tell Chef the minimum number of operations needed to turn the sequence AA into a good sequence or determine that it is impossible.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer NN.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of required operations, or −1−1 if it is impossible to make the sequence good.

Explanation

Example case 1: The sequence is already good, so the answer is zero.

Example case 2: We can make the sequence good in two operations, e.g. [1,0,1,0]→[0,1,1,0]→[0,0,2,0][1,0,1,0]→[0,1,1,0]→[0,0,2,0].

Example case 3: We can make the sequence good in three operations, e.g. [1,1,0,1,0]→[0,2,0,1,0]→[0,2,1,0,0]→[0,3,0,0,0][1,1,0,1,0]→[0,2,0,1,0]→[0,2,1,0,0]→[0,3,0,0,0].

You are given a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN), rooted at node 11. For each valid ii, node ii has a value aiai written on it.

An undirected simple path between any two nodes uu and vv is said to be vertical if u=vu=v or uu is an ancestor of vv or vv is an ancestor of uu. Let's define a vertical partition of the tree as a set of vertical paths such that each node belongs to exactly one of these paths.

You are also given a sequence of NN integers b1,b2,…,bNb1,b2,…,bN. A vertical partition is good if, for each of its paths, we can permute the values written on the nodes in this path, and this can be done in such a way that we reach a state where for each valid ii, the value written on node ii is bibi.

The difficulty of your task is described by a parameter SS. If S=1S=1, your task is only to determine whether at least one good vertical partition exists. If S=2S=2, you are required to find the number of good vertical partitions modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+7109+7).

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and SS.
Each of the next N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting that nodes uu and vv are connected by an edge.
The next line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.
The line after that contains NN space-separated integers b1,b2,…,bNb1,b2,…,bN.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer:

If S=1S=1, this integer should be 11 if a good vertical partition exists or 00 if it does not exist.
If S=2S=2, this integer should be the number of good vertical partitions modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+7109+7).

Explanation

Example case 1: The good vertical partitions are {[1],[2,3]}{[1],[2,3]} and {[1,2,3]}{[1,2,3]}.

Example case 2: The good vertical partitions are:

{[1,2,4],[3,5],[6]}{[1,2,4],[3,5],[6]}
{[1],[2,4],[3,5],[6]}{[1],[2,4],[3,5],[6]}
{[1,3,5],[2,4],[6]}{[1,3,5],[2,4],[6]}

Example case 3: The same as example case 2, but with S=1S=1.

Example case 4: There is no good vertical partition.

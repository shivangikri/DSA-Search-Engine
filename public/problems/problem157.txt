Chef has a tree with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN) and a non-negative integer xx. The nodes of the tree have non-negative integer weights; let's denote the weight of node ii by aiai.

Next, let's define the XOR value of a tree as the bitwise XOR of weights of all its nodes.

Chef wants to remove zero or more edges from his tree in such a way that each individual tree in the forest formed by removing these edges has XOR value xx. Help him compute the number of ways to remove a set of edges such that this condition is satisfied. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and xx.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers a1,a2,…,aNa1,a2,…,aN.
Each of the following N−1N−1 lines contains two space-separated integers uu and vv denoting an edge between nodes uu and vv in Chef's tree.

Output

Print a single line containing one integer ― the number of ways to remove edges, modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation

There are five valid ways to remove edges, splitting the tree into subtrees on nodes:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and [7] by removing the edge (3-7)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7] and [5] by removing the edge (2-5)
[2, 4, 5] and [1, 3, 6, 7] by removing the edge (1-2)
[2, 4, 5], [1], [3,6] and [7] by removing edges (1-2), (1-3) and (3-7)
[1, 2, 4], [5], [3,6] and [7] by removing edges (2-5), (1-3) and (3-7)

There is a building with NN floors (numbered 11 through NN from bottom to top); on each floor, there are MM windows (numbered 11 through MM from left to right). Let's denote the jj-th window on the ii-th floor by (i,j)(i,j).

All windows in the building need to be cleaned one by one in a specific order. You are given this order as a matrix AA with NN rows and MM columns; for each valid ii and jj, the window (i,j)(i,j) must be cleaned on the AN−i+1,jAN−i+1,j-th turn.

Whenever we clean a window (i,j)(i,j), it becomes clean, but the dirty water used for cleaning it flows down to windows (i−1,j−1)(i−1,j−1), (i−1,j)(i−1,j) and (i−1,j+1)(i−1,j+1) (more precisely, to all of these windows which exist), so these windows become dirty again. Then, the water flows further down, so the same applies for other windows below: whenever a window (i,j)(i,j) becomes dirty, windows (i−1,j−1)(i−1,j−1), (i−1,j)(i−1,j) and (i−1,j+1)(i−1,j+1) become dirty as well. For example, cleaning a window (5,3)(5,3) will make the window (3,2)(3,2) dirty. The next window is cleaned only after water flows down completely. Note that each window is cleaned only once and there may be dirty windows at the end.

For each window, determine whether it will be clean after the cleaning process ends.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and MM. 
NN lines follow. For each ii (1≤i≤N1≤i≤N), the ii-th of these lines contains MM space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,MAi,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,M.

Output

For each test case, print NN lines; each of them should contain a string with length MM. For each valid ii and jj, the jj-th character on the ii-th line should be '1' if the window (N−i+1,j)(N−i+1,j) is clean or '0' if it is dirty.

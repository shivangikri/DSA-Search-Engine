“Jesse, you asked me if I was in the meth business, or the money business… Neither. I’m in the empire business.”

Walter’s sold his stack in Gray Matter Technologies, a company which he deserved half a credit, for peanuts. Now this company is worth a billion dollar company. Walter wants to get it's shares to have his Empire Business back and he founds an opportunity.

There are NN persons having shares A1,A2,A3,…ANA1,A2,A3,…AN in this company. Walter can buy these shares with their minimum Sold Values.

Sold Values of a person's share ii (1≤i≤N)(1≤i≤N) with another person's share jj (1≤j≤N)(1≤j≤N) is equal to Aj+|i−j|Aj+|i−j|. So, a person's share can have NN possible sold values and Walter has to find minimum sold value among them for each person.

Since Walter has to run his meth business also he asks you to find minimum sold value for each person.

Input:

First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the testcases follow. 
The First line of each test case contains a integer NN.
The Second line of each test case contains NN space integers namely A1,A2,…ANA1,A2,…AN.

Output:

For each test case, output in single line NN space integers denoting minimum sold value for each person.

Constraints

1≤T≤1051≤T≤105
1≤N≤2∗1061≤N≤2∗106
1≤Ai≤1091≤Ai≤109

Sum of NN over all test cases will not exceed 2∗1062∗106.

Explanation

For first case:

Sold value for index 11:  6,6,7,8,66,6,7,8,6
Sold value for index 22:  7,5,6,7,57,5,6,7,5
Sold value for index 33:  8,6,5,6,48,6,5,6,4
Sold value for index 44:  9,7,6,5,39,7,6,5,3
Sold value for index 55:  10,8,7,6,210,8,7,6,2

Minimum sold value for each index will be 6,5,4,3,26,5,4,3,2.

Meanwhile, Candace and Stacy are busy planning to attend the concert of the famous Love Händel. Jeremy will also be attending the event. Therefore, Candace plans to offer the best possible gift to Jeremy.

Candace has NN strings, each of length MM. Each character of each string can either be a lowercase English letter or the character '#'. She denotes the substring of ii-thth string starting from the ll-thth character and ending with the rr-thth character as Si[l,r]Si[l,r]. She has to choose a list aa of N−1N−1 numbers such that

1≤a1≤a2≤a3≤...≤aN−1≤M1≤a1≤a2≤a3≤...≤aN−1≤M.
The final gift string is obtained by appending the substrings S1[1,a1]S1[1,a1], S2[a1,a2]S2[a1,a2], S3[a2,a3]S3[a2,a3], .., SN−1[aN−2,aN−1]SN−1[aN−2,aN−1], SN[aN−1,M]SN[aN−1,M].
Candace considers the gift to be the most beautiful one if the final gift string is the lexicographically smallest possible string and it doesn't contain the '#' character.

Let PP = S1[1,a1]S1[1,a1] + S2[a1,a2]S2[a1,a2] + S3[a2,a3]S3[a2,a3] + .., + SN−1[aN−2,aN−1]SN−1[aN−2,aN−1] + SN[aN−1,M]SN[aN−1,M], then PP should be the lexicographically smallest string  possible and it should not contain '#' character, where '+' denotes concatenation of two substrings.

Help Candace find the best possible gift string quickly as she does not want Jeremy to wait for her. Also, it is guaranteed that at least one such valid string exists.

Input

The first line contains a single integer TT denoting the number of testcases.
The first line of each test case contains 22 space separated integers denoting the values of NN and MM respectively.
NN lines follow. Each line contains a string SiSi of length MM as described above.

Output

For every test case, print a line containing lexicographically lowest possible gift string.

Constraints

1≤T≤1041≤T≤104
1≤N,M≤1061≤N,M≤106
|Si|=M|Si|=M
All SiSi will contain either a lower English letter ('a' to 'z' ) or the character '#' (ASCII 3535).
Sum of N∗MN∗M over all test cases for a particular test file does not exceed 107107.
It is guaranteed that a valid solution will always exist.

Sample Output

xabza

Explanation

For test 11:

The array aa chosen is: [3,3][3,3]

The resulting string PP is formed by = S1[1,3]S1[1,3] + S2[3,3]S2[3,3] + S3[3,3]S3[3,3] = xabza

For test 22:

The array aa chosen is: [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4]

The resulting string PP is formed by = S1[1,1]S1[1,1] + S2[1,2]S2[1,2] + S3[2,3]S3[2,3] + S4[3,4]S4[3,4] + S5[4,4]S5[4,4] = pvcbihjz

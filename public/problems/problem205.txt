You are given an undirected graph with NN nodes (numbered 11 through NN) and MM edges. Each edge connects two distinct nodes. However, there may be multiple edges connecting the same pairs of nodes, and they are considered to be distinct edges. A lowercase English letter is written in each node.

You are also given a string SS with length LL. A beautiful path is a sequence of L−1L−1 edges such that there is a sequence of LL nodes with the following properties:

for each valid ii, the ii-th edge connects the ii-th and (i+1)(i+1)-th of these nodes
for each valid ii, the ii-th character of SS is written in the ii-th of these nodes

There are no other restrictions — a path may visit nodes or edges any number of times in any order.

Determine the number of beautiful paths in the graph. Since the answer can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+7.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and LL.
The second line contains a single string SS with length LL.
The third line contains a single string with length NN. For each valid ii, the ii-th character of the string is the letter written in the ii-th node.
Two lines follow. The first line contains MM integers u1,…,umu1,…,um. The second lines contains MM integers, v1,…,vmv1,…,vm. This denotes that there is an edge connecting nodes uiui and to vivi. These edges are distinct, even though they may connect the same pair of nodes.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of beautiful paths modulo 109+7109+7.

Explanation

Example case 1: The three beautiful paths (sequences of edges) are:

(1,2)(1,2), passing through nodes (1,2,3)(1,2,3) in this order
(4,2)(4,2), also passing through nodes (1,2,3)(1,2,3)
(3,2)(3,2), passing through nodes (4,2,3)(4,2,3)

Example case 2: There is only one beautiful path, which contains only edge 11. Note that for this path (sequence of edges), there are two valid sequences of nodes: (1,2)(1,2) and (2,1)(2,1).

Consider NN binary variables x1,x2,…,xNx1,x2,…,xN. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these variables can be xi=0xi=0 or xi=1xi=1; therefore, there are 2N2N possible assignments of values to the variables. For each valid ii, setting xi=1xi=1 gives you score gigi.

In addition, there are MM special intervals (numbered 11 through MM). For each valid ii, the ii-th interval is [ui,vi][ui,vi] and if xui=xui+1=…=xvi=1xui=xui+1=…=xvi=1, then your score increases by didi.

Note that both gigi and didi can be negative (setting more variables to 11 can decrease your score), and your score can also be negative. Formally, the score of an assignment of values to the binary variables is
∑i=1Ngi⋅xi+∑i=1Mdi⋅∏j=uivixj.∑i=1Ngi⋅xi+∑i=1Mdi⋅∏j=uivixj.

Find the KK highest scores among all assignments on these variables. Formally, if we computed the scores of all 2N2N assignments and sorted them in non-increasing order, you should find the first KK of these values.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NN, MM and KK.
The second line contains NN space-separated integers g1,g2,…,gNg1,g2,…,gN.
MM lines follow. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers uiui, vivi and didi.

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing KK space-separated integers ― the KK highest scores of assignments on the binary variables, in decreasing order.

Explanation

Example case 1: The best assignment is x=(0,0,1,1)x=(0,0,1,1), with score 77. The second and third best assignments are (0,0,1,0)(0,0,1,0) and (0,1,1,1)(0,1,1,1), each with score 55.

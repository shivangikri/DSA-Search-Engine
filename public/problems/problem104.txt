You are given a string SS. Find the number of ways to choose an unordered pair of non-overlapping non-empty substrings of this string (let's denote them by s1s1 and s2s2 in such a way that s2s2 starts after s1s1 ends) such that their concatenation s1+s2s1+s2 is a palindrome.

Two pairs (s1,s2)(s1,s2) and (s′1,s′2)(s1′,s2′) are different if s1s1 is chosen at a different position from s′1s1′ or s2s2 is chosen at a different position from s′2s2′.

Input

The first and only line of the input contains a single string SS.

Output

Print a single line containing one integer — the number of ways to choose a valid pair of substrings.

Constraints

1≤|S|≤1,0001≤|S|≤1,000
SS contains only lowercase English letters

Subtasks

Subtask #1 (25 points): |S|≤100|S|≤100

Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

Sample Input 1

abba

Sample Output 1

7

Explanation

The following pairs of substrings can be chosen: ("a", "a"), ("a", "ba"), ("a", "bba"), ("ab", "a"), ("ab", "ba"), ("abb", "a"), ("b", "b").

Baby Ehab has a piece of Cut and Stick with an array aa of length nn written on it. He plans to grab a pair of scissors and do the following to it:  pick a range (l,r)(l,r) and cut out every element alal, al+1al+1, ..., arar in this range;  stick some of the elements together in the same order they were in the array;  end up with multiple pieces, where every piece contains some of the elements and every element belongs to some piece. More formally, he partitions the sequence alal, al+1al+1, ..., arar into subsequences. He thinks a partitioning is beautiful if for every piece (subsequence) it holds that, if it has length xx, then no value occurs strictly more than ⌈x2⌉⌈x2⌉ times in it.He didn't pick a range yet, so he's wondering: for qq ranges (l,r)(l,r), what is the minimum number of pieces he needs to partition the elements alal, al+1al+1, ..., arar into so that the partitioning is beautiful.A sequence bb is a subsequence of an array aa if bb can be obtained from aa by deleting some (possibly zero) elements. Note that it does not have to be contiguous.
InputThe first line contains two integers nn and qq (1≤n,q≤3⋅1051≤n,q≤3⋅105) — the length of the array aa and the number of queries.The second line contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan (1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n) — the elements of the array aa.Each of the next qq lines contains two integers ll and rr (1≤l≤r≤n1≤l≤r≤n) — the range of this query.
OutputFor each query, print the minimum number of subsequences you need to partition this range into so that the partitioning is beautiful. We can prove such partitioning always exists.

NoteIn the first query, you can just put the whole array in one subsequence, since its length is 66, and no value occurs more than 33 times in it.In the second query, the elements of the query range are [3,2,3,3][3,2,3,3]. You can't put them all in one subsequence, since its length is 44, and 33 occurs more than 22 times. However, you can partition it into two subsequences: [3][3] and [2,3,3][2,3,3].

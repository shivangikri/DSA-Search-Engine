Phoenix's homeland, the Fire Nation had nn cities that were connected by mm roads, but the roads were all destroyed by an earthquake. The Fire Nation wishes to repair n−1n−1 of these roads so that all the cities are connected again. The ii-th city has aiai tons of asphalt. xx tons of asphalt are used up when repairing a road, and to repair a road between ii and jj, cities ii and jj must have at least xx tons of asphalt between them. In other words, if city ii had aiai tons of asphalt and city jj had ajaj tons, there would remain ai+aj−xai+aj−x tons after repairing the road between them. Asphalt can be moved between cities if the road between them is already repaired.Please determine if it is possible to connect all the cities, and if so, output any sequence of roads to repair.
InputThe first line contains integers nn, mm, and xx (2≤n≤3⋅1052≤n≤3⋅105; n−1≤m≤3⋅105n−1≤m≤3⋅105; 1≤x≤1091≤x≤109) — the number of cities, number of roads, and amount of asphalt needed to repair one road.The next line contains nn space-separated integer aiai (0≤ai≤1090≤ai≤109) — the amount of asphalt initially at city ii.The next mm lines contains two integers xixi and yiyi (xi≠yixi≠yi; 1≤xi,yi≤n1≤xi,yi≤n) — the cities connected by the ii-th road. It is guaranteed that there is at most one road between each pair of cities, and that the city was originally connected before the earthquake.
OutputIf it is not possible to connect all the cities, print NO. Otherwise, print YES followed by n−1n−1 integers e1,e2,…,en−1e1,e2,…,en−1, the order in which the roads should be repaired. eiei is the index of the ii-th road to repair. If there are multiple solutions, print any.

NoteIn the first example, the roads are repaired in the following order:   Road 33 is repaired, connecting cities 33 and 44. City 44 originally had 44 tons of asphalt. After this road is constructed, 33 tons remain.  Road 22 is repaired, connecting cities 22 and 33. The asphalt from city 44 can be transported to city 33 and used for the road. 22 tons remain.  Road 11 is repaired, connecting cities 11 and 22. The asphalt is transported to city 22 and used for the road. 11 ton remain.  Road 44 is repaired, connecting cities 44 and 55. The asphalt is transported to city 44 and used for the road. No asphalt remains.  All the cities are now connected.In the second example, cities 11 and 22 use all their asphalt together to build the road. They each have 11 ton, so together they have 22 tons, which is enough.In the third example, there isn't enough asphalt to connect cities 11 and 22.

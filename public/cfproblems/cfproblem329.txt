You are given the sequence of integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an of length nn. The sequence of indices i1<i2<…<iki1<i2<…<ik of length kk denotes the subsequence ai1,ai2,…,aikai1,ai2,…,aik of length kk of sequence aa.The subsequence ai1,ai2,…,aikai1,ai2,…,aik of length kk of sequence aa is called increasing subsequence if aij<aij+1aij<aij+1 for each 1≤j<k1≤j<k.The weight of the increasing subsequence ai1,ai2,…,aikai1,ai2,…,aik of length kk of sequence aa is the number of 1≤j≤k1≤j≤k, such that exists index ik<x≤nik<x≤n and ax>aijax>aij.For example, if a=[6,4,8,6,5]a=[6,4,8,6,5], then the sequence of indices i=[2,4]i=[2,4] denotes increasing subsequence [4,6][4,6] of sequence aa. The weight of this increasing subsequence is 11, because for j=1j=1 exists x=5x=5 and a5=5>ai1=4a5=5>ai1=4, but for j=2j=2 such xx doesn't exist.Find the sum of weights of all increasing subsequences of aa modulo 109+7109+7.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤10001≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains the single integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the sequence aa.The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — the sequence aa.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputFor each test case, print the sum of weights of all increasing subsequences aa modulo 109+7109+7.

NoteIn the first test case the following increasing subsequences of aa have not zero weight:   The weight of [a1]=[6][a1]=[6] is 11.  The weight of [a2]=[4][a2]=[4] is 11.  The weight of [a2,a3]=[4,8][a2,a3]=[4,8] is 11.  The weight of [a2,a4]=[4,6][a2,a4]=[4,6] is 11.  The sum of weights of increasing subsequences is 44.In the second test case there are 77 increasing subsequences of aa with not zero weight: 33 with weight 11, 33 with weight 22 and 11 with weight 33. The sum of weights is 1212.

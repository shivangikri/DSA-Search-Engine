nn players are playing a game. There are two different maps in the game. For each player, we know his strength on each map. When two players fight on a specific map, the player with higher strength on that map always wins. No two players have the same strength on the same map. You are the game master and want to organize a tournament. There will be a total of n−1n−1 battles. While there is more than one player in the tournament, choose any map and any two remaining players to fight on it. The player who loses will be eliminated from the tournament. In the end, exactly one player will remain, and he is declared the winner of the tournament. For each player determine if he can win the tournament.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105) — the number of players.The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109, ai≠ajai≠aj for i≠ji≠j), where aiai is the strength of the ii-th player on the first map. The third line of each test case contains nn integers b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤1091≤bi≤109, bi≠bjbi≠bj for i≠ji≠j), where bibi is the strength of the ii-th player on the second map. It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.
OutputFor each test case print a string of length nn. ii-th character should be "1" if the ii-th player can win the tournament, or "0" otherwise.

NoteIn the first test case, the 44-th player will beat any other player on any game, so he will definitely win the tournament.In the second test case, everyone can be a winner. In the third test case, there is only one player. Clearly, he will win the tournament.

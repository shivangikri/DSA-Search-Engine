You are given nn points with integer coordinates on a coordinate axis OXOX. The coordinate of the ii-th point is xixi. All points' coordinates are distinct and given in strictly increasing order.For each point ii, you can do the following operation no more than once: take this point and move it by 11 to the left or to the right (i..e., you can change its coordinate xixi to xi−1xi−1 or to xi+1xi+1). In other words, for each point, you choose (separately) its new coordinate. For the ii-th point, it can be either xi−1xi−1, xixi or xi+1xi+1.Your task is to determine if you can move some points as described above in such a way that the new set of points forms a consecutive segment of integers, i. e. for some integer ll the coordinates of points should be equal to l,l+1,…,l+n−1l,l+1,…,l+n−1.Note that the resulting points should have distinct coordinates.You have to answer tt independent test cases.
InputThe first line of the input contains one integer tt (1≤t≤2⋅1041≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.The first line of the test case contains one integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of points in the set xx.The second line of the test case contains nn integers x1<x2<…<xnx1<x2<…<xn (1≤xi≤1061≤xi≤106), where xixi is the coordinate of the ii-th point.It is guaranteed that the points are given in strictly increasing order (this also means that all coordinates are distinct). It is also guaranteed that the sum of nn does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105 (∑n≤2⋅105∑n≤2⋅105).
OutputFor each test case, print the answer — if the set of points from the test case can be moved to form a consecutive segment of integers, print YES, otherwise print NO.

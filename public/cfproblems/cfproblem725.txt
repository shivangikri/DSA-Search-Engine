You are given an array ss consisting of nn different strings. Each string consists of mm lowercase Latin letters.You have to respond to qq queries. Each query contains a string tt of length m+1m+1. Count the number of indices ii, such that the string tt can be obtained from the string sisi, if it is allowed to insert one letter in an arbitrary position.
InputThe first line contains two integers nn and mm (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105; 1≤m≤101≤m≤10) — the number of strings in the array and the length of each string.The following nn lines contain strings sisi. All of the given strings are different.The next line contains a single integer qq (1≤q≤1051≤q≤105) — the number of queries.The following qq lines contain query strings tt of length m+1m+1.
OutputFor each query, print the number of indices ii, such that a string from the query can be obtained from the string sisi, if it is allowed to insert one letter in an arbitrary position.

NoteExplanation of the first test of the example:  the string a can be transformed into aa by inserting one letter;  both strings a and c can be transformed into ca by inserting one letter;  neither a nor c can be transformed into mm by inserting one letter;  c can be transformed into cf by inserting one letter.

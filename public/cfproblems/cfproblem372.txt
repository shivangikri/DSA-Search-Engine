You are given three integers n,a,bn,a,b. Determine if there exists a permutation p1,p2,…,pnp1,p2,…,pn of integers from 11 to nn, such that:There are exactly aa integers ii with 2≤i≤n−12≤i≤n−1 such that pi−1<pi>pi+1pi−1<pi>pi+1 (in other words, there are exactly aa local maximums).There are exactly bb integers ii with 2≤i≤n−12≤i≤n−1 such that pi−1>pi<pi+1pi−1>pi<pi+1 (in other words, there are exactly bb local minimums).If such permutations exist, find any such permutation.
InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains three integers nn, aa and bb (2≤n≤1052≤n≤105, 0≤a,b≤n0≤a,b≤n).The sum of nn over all test cases doesn't exceed 105105.
OutputFor each test case, if there is no permutation with the requested properties, output −1−1.Otherwise, print the permutation that you are found. If there are several such permutations, you may print any of them.

NoteIn the first test case, one example of such permutations is [1,3,2,4][1,3,2,4]. In it p1<p2>p3p1<p2>p3, and 22 is the only such index, and p2>p3<p4p2>p3<p4, and 33 the only such index.One can show that there is no such permutation for the third test case.

Consider a sequence of distinct integers a1,…,ana1,…,an, each representing one node of a graph. There is an edge between two nodes if the two values are not coprime, i. e. they have a common divisor greater than 11.There are qq queries, in each query, you want to get from one given node asas to another atat. In order to achieve that, you can choose an existing value aiai and create new value an+1=ai⋅(1+ai)an+1=ai⋅(1+ai), with edges to all values that are not coprime with an+1an+1. Also, nn gets increased by 11. You can repeat that operation multiple times, possibly making the sequence much longer and getting huge or repeated values. What's the minimum possible number of newly created nodes so that atat is reachable from asas?Queries are independent. In each query, you start with the initial sequence aa given in the input.
InputThe first line contains two integers nn and qq (2≤n≤1500002≤n≤150000, 1≤q≤3000001≤q≤300000) — the size of the sequence and the number of queries.The second line contains nn distinct integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (2≤ai≤1062≤ai≤106, ai≠ajai≠aj if i≠ji≠j).The jj-th of the following qq lines contains two distinct integers sjsj and tjtj (1≤sj,tj≤n1≤sj,tj≤n, sj≠tjsj≠tj) — indices of nodes for jj-th query.
OutputPrint qq lines. The jj-th line should contain one integer: the minimum number of new nodes you create in order to move from asjasj to atjatj.

NoteIn the first example, you can first create new value 2⋅3=62⋅3=6 or 10⋅11=11010⋅11=110 or 3⋅4=123⋅4=12. None of that is needed in the first query because you can already get from a1=2a1=2 to a2=10a2=10.In the second query, it's optimal to first create 66 or 1212. For example, creating 66 makes it possible to get from a1=2a1=2 to a3=3a3=3 with a path (2,6,3)(2,6,3).  In the last query of the second example, we want to get from a3=7a3=7 to a5=25a5=25. One way to achieve that is to first create 6⋅7=426⋅7=42 and then create 25⋅26=65025⋅26=650. The final graph has seven nodes and it contains a path from a3=7a3=7 to a5=25a5=25.

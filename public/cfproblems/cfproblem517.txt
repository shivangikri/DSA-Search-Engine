Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid aa of size n×mn×mEach cell (x,y)(x,y) contains an integer ax,yax,y denoting the direction of how the ball will move.  ax,y=1ax,y=1 — the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x,y+1)(x,y+1));  ax,y=2ax,y=2 — the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x+1,y)(x+1,y));  ax,y=3ax,y=3 — the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x,y−1)(x,y−1)). Every time a ball leaves a cell (x,y)(x,y), the integer ax,yax,y will change to 22. Mr. Chanek will drop kk balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c1,c2,…,ckc1,c2,…,ck-th (1≤ci≤m1≤ci≤m) columns.Determine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).
InputThe first line contains three integers nn, mm, and kk (1≤n,m≤10001≤n,m≤1000, 1≤k≤1051≤k≤105) — the size of the grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek.The ii-th of the next nn lines contains mm integers ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,mai,1,ai,2,…,ai,m (1≤ai,j≤31≤ai,j≤3). It will satisfy ai,1≠3ai,1≠3 and ai,m≠1ai,m≠1.The next line contains kk integers c1,c2,…,ckc1,c2,…,ck (1≤ci≤m1≤ci≤m) — the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.
OutputOutput kk integers — the ii-th integer denoting the column where the ii-th ball will end.

NoteIn the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the cell (1,1)(1,1) will change direction to the bottom direction.  The second and third balls will drop as follows.   All balls will be dropped from the first row and on the c1,c2,…,ckc1,c2,…,ck-th columns respectively. A ball will stop dropping once it leaves the grid.

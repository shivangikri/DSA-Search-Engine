You are given an array aa consisting of nn positive integers, and an array bb, with length nn. Initially bi=0bi=0 for each 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n.In one move you can choose an integer ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n), and add aiai to bibi or subtract aiai from bibi. What is the minimum number of moves needed to make bb increasing (that is, every element is strictly greater than every element before it)?
InputThe first line contains a single integer nn (2≤n≤50002≤n≤5000).The second line contains nn integers, a1a1, a2a2, ..., anan (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array aa.
OutputPrint a single integer, the minimum number of moves to make bb increasing.

NoteExample 11: you can subtract a1a1 from b1b1, and add a3a3, a4a4, and a5a5 to b3b3, b4b4, and b5b5 respectively. The final array will be [−1−1, 00, 33, 44, 55] after 44 moves.Example 22: you can reach [−3−3, −2−2, −1−1, 00, 11, 22, 33] in 1010 moves.

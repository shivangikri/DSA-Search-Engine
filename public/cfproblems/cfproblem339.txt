One day, early in the morning, you decided to buy yourself a bag of chips in the nearby store. The store has chips of nn different flavors. A bag of the ii-th flavor costs aiai burles.The store may run out of some flavors, so you'll decide which one to buy after arriving there. But there are two major flaws in this plan:   you have only coins of 11, 22 and 33 burles;  since it's morning, the store will ask you to pay in exact change, i. e. if you choose the ii-th flavor, you'll have to pay exactly aiai burles. Coins are heavy, so you'd like to take the least possible number of coins in total. That's why you are wondering: what is the minimum total number of coins you should take with you, so you can buy a bag of chips of any flavor in exact change?
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤10001≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains the single integer nn (1≤n≤1001≤n≤100) — the number of flavors in the store.The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — the cost of one bag of each flavor.
OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you need to buy one bag of any flavor you'll choose in exact change.

NoteIn the first test case, you should, for example, take with you 445445 coins of value 33 and 11 coin of value 22. So, 1337=445⋅3+1⋅21337=445⋅3+1⋅2.In the second test case, you should, for example, take 22 coins of value 33 and 22 coins of value 22. So you can pay either exactly 8=2⋅3+1⋅28=2⋅3+1⋅2 or 10=2⋅3+2⋅210=2⋅3+2⋅2.In the third test case, it's enough to take 11 coin of value 33 and 22 coins of value 11.

You are an ambitious king who wants to be the Emperor of The Reals. But to do that, you must first become Emperor of The Integers.Consider a number axis. The capital of your empire is initially at 00. There are nn unconquered kingdoms at positions 0<x1<x2<…<xn0<x1<x2<…<xn. You want to conquer all other kingdoms.There are two actions available to you:   You can change the location of your capital (let its current position be c1c1) to any other conquered kingdom (let its position be c2c2) at a cost of a⋅|c1−c2|a⋅|c1−c2|.  From the current capital (let its current position be c1c1) you can conquer an unconquered kingdom (let its position be c2c2) at a cost of b⋅|c1−c2|b⋅|c1−c2|. You cannot conquer a kingdom if there is an unconquered kingdom between the target and your capital. Note that you cannot place the capital at a point without a kingdom. In other words, at any point, your capital can only be at 00 or one of x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn. Also note that conquering a kingdom does not change the position of your capital.Find the minimum total cost to conquer all kingdoms. Your capital can be anywhere at the end.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤10001≤t≤1000)  — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.The first line of each test case contains 33 integers nn, aa, and bb (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105; 1≤a,b≤1051≤a,b≤105).The second line of each test case contains nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn (1≤x1<x2<…<xn≤1081≤x1<x2<…<xn≤108).The sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputFor each test case, output a single integer  — the minimum cost to conquer all kingdoms.

NoteHere is an optimal sequence of moves for the second test case:  Conquer the kingdom at position 11 with cost 3⋅(1−0)=33⋅(1−0)=3.  Move the capital to the kingdom at position 11 with cost 6⋅(1−0)=66⋅(1−0)=6.  Conquer the kingdom at position 55 with cost 3⋅(5−1)=123⋅(5−1)=12.  Move the capital to the kingdom at position 55 with cost 6⋅(5−1)=246⋅(5−1)=24.  Conquer the kingdom at position 66 with cost 3⋅(6−5)=33⋅(6−5)=3.  Conquer the kingdom at position 2121 with cost 3⋅(21−5)=483⋅(21−5)=48.  Conquer the kingdom at position 3030 with cost 3⋅(30−5)=753⋅(30−5)=75. The total cost is 3+6+12+24+3+48+75=1713+6+12+24+3+48+75=171. You cannot get a lower cost than this.

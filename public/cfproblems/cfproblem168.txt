You are given a list of nn integers. You can perform the following operation: you choose an element xx from the list, erase xx from the list, and subtract the value of xx from all the remaining elements. Thus, in one operation, the length of the list is decreased by exactly 11.Given an integer kk (k>0k>0), find if there is some sequence of n−1n−1 operations such that, after applying the operations, the only remaining element of the list is equal to kk.
InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (2≤n≤2⋅1052≤n≤2⋅105, 1≤k≤1091≤k≤109), the number of integers in the list, and the target value, respectively.The second line of each test case contains the nn integers of the list a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (−109≤ai≤109−109≤ai≤109).It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases is not greater that 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputFor each test case, print YES if you can achieve kk with a sequence of n−1n−1 operations. Otherwise, print NO.You may print each letter in any case (for example, "YES", "Yes", "yes", "yEs" will all be recognized as a positive answer).

NoteIn the first example we have the list {4,2,2,7}{4,2,2,7}, and we have the target k=5k=5. One way to achieve it is the following: first we choose the third element, obtaining the list {2,0,5}{2,0,5}. Next we choose the first element, obtaining the list {−2,3}{−2,3}. Finally, we choose the first element, obtaining the list {5}{5}.

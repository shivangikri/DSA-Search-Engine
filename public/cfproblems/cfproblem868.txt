Based on a peculiar incident at basketball practice, Akari came up with the following competitive programming problem!You are given nn points on the plane, no three of which are collinear. The ii-th point initially has a label aiai, in such a way that the labels a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an form a permutation of 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.You are allowed to modify the labels through the following operation:  Choose two distinct integers ii and jj between 11 and nn.  Swap the labels of points ii and jj, and finally  Draw the segment between points ii and jj. A sequence of operations is valid if after applying all of the operations in the sequence in order, the kk-th point ends up having the label kk for all kk between 11 and nn inclusive, and the drawn segments don't intersect each other internally. Formally, if two of the segments intersect, then they must do so at a common endpoint of both segments.In particular, all drawn segments must be distinct.Find any valid sequence of operations, or say that none exist. 
InputThe first line contains an integer nn (3≤n≤20003≤n≤2000)  — the number of points.The ii-th of the following nn lines contains three integers xixi, yiyi, aiai (−106≤xi,yi≤106−106≤xi,yi≤106, 1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n), representing that the ii-th point has coordinates (xi,yi)(xi,yi) and initially has label aiai.It is guaranteed that all points are distinct, no three points are collinear, and the labels a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an form a permutation of 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n.
OutputIf it is impossible to perform a valid sequence of operations, print −1−1.Otherwise, print an integer kk (0≤k≤n(n−1)20≤k≤n(n−1)2)  — the number of operations to perform, followed by kk lines, each containing two integers ii and jj (1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n, i≠ji≠j)  — the indices of the points chosen for the operation.Note that you are not required to minimize or maximize the value of kk.If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.

NoteThe following animation showcases the first sample test case. The black numbers represent the indices of the points, while the boxed orange numbers represent their labels.  In the second test case, all labels are already in their correct positions, so no operations are necessary.

One day Masha was walking in the park and found a graph under a tree... Surprised? Did you think that this problem would have some logical and reasoned story? No way! So, the problem...Masha has an oriented graph which ii-th vertex contains some positive integer aiai. Initially Masha can put a coin at some vertex. In one operation she can move a coin placed in some vertex uu to any other vertex vv such that there is an oriented edge u→vu→v in the graph. Each time when the coin is placed in some vertex ii, Masha write down an integer aiai in her notebook (in particular, when Masha initially puts a coin at some vertex, she writes an integer written at this vertex in her notebook). Masha wants to make exactly k−1k−1 operations in such way that the maximum number written in her notebook is as small as possible.
InputThe first line contains three integers nn, mm and kk (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105, 0≤m≤2⋅1050≤m≤2⋅105, 1≤k≤10181≤k≤1018) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of operation that Masha should make.The second line contains nn integers aiai (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — the numbers written in graph vertices.Each of the following mm lines contains two integers uu and vv (1≤u≠v≤n1≤u≠v≤n) — it means that there is an edge u→vu→v in the graph.It's guaranteed that graph doesn't contain loops and multi-edges.
OutputPrint one integer — the minimum value of the maximum number that Masha wrote in her notebook during optimal coin movements.If Masha won't be able to perform k−1k−1 operations, print −1−1.

NoteGraph described in the first and the second examples is illustrated below.  In the first example Masha can initially put a coin at vertex 11. After that she can perform three operations: 1→31→3, 3→43→4 and 4→54→5. Integers 1,2,31,2,3 and 44 will be written in the notepad.In the second example Masha can initially put a coin at vertex 22. After that she can perform 9999 operations: 2→52→5, 5→65→6, 6→26→2, 2→52→5, and so on. Integers 10,4,5,10,4,5,…,10,4,5,1010,4,5,10,4,5,…,10,4,5,10 will be written in the notepad.In the third example Masha won't be able to perform 44 operations.

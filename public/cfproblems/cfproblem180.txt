You are given nn distinct points on a plane. The coordinates of the ii-th point are (xi,yi)(xi,yi).For each point ii, find the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) point with integer coordinates that is not among the given nn points. If there are multiple such points — you can choose any of them.The Manhattan distance between two points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) is |x1−x2|+|y1−y2||x1−x2|+|y1−y2|.
InputThe first line of the input contains one integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of points in the set.The next nn lines describe points. The ii-th of them contains two integers xixi and yiyi (1≤xi,yi≤2⋅1051≤xi,yi≤2⋅105) — coordinates of the ii-th point.It is guaranteed that all points in the input are distinct.
OutputPrint nn lines. In the ii-th line, print the point with integer coordinates that is not among the given nn points and is the nearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) to the ii-th point from the input.Output coordinates should be in range [−106;106][−106;106]. It can be shown that any optimal answer meets these constraints.If there are several answers, you can print any of them.

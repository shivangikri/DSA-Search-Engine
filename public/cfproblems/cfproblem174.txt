Alice's potion making professor gave the following assignment to his students: brew a potion using nn ingredients, such that the proportion of ingredient ii in the final potion is ri>0ri>0 (and r1+r2+⋯+rn=1r1+r2+⋯+rn=1).He forgot the recipe, and now all he remembers is a set of n−1n−1 facts of the form, "ingredients ii and jj should have a ratio of xx to yy" (i.e., if aiai and ajaj are the amounts of ingredient ii and jj in the potion respectively, then it must hold ai/aj=x/yai/aj=x/y), where xx and yy are positive integers. However, it is guaranteed that the set of facts he remembers is sufficient to uniquely determine the original values riri.He decided that he will allow the students to pass the class as long as they submit a potion which satisfies all of the n−1n−1 requirements (there may be many such satisfactory potions), and contains a positive integer amount of each ingredient.Find the minimum total amount of ingredients needed to make a potion which passes the class. As the result can be very large, you should print the answer modulo 998244353998244353.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (2≤n≤2⋅1052≤n≤2⋅105).Each of the next n−1n−1 lines contains four integers i,j,x,yi,j,x,y (1≤i,j≤n1≤i,j≤n, i≠ji≠j, 1≤x,y≤n1≤x,y≤n) — ingredients ii and jj should have a ratio of xx to yy. It is guaranteed that the set of facts is sufficient to uniquely determine the original values riri.It is also guaranteed that the sum of nn for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputFor each test case, print the minimum total amount of ingredients needed to make a potion which passes the class, modulo 998244353998244353.

NoteIn the first test case, the minimum total amount of ingredients is 6969. In fact, the amounts of ingredients 1,2,3,41,2,3,4 of a valid potion are 16,12,9,3216,12,9,32, respectively. The potion is valid because   Ingredients 33 and 22 have a ratio of 9:12=3:49:12=3:4;  Ingredients 11 and 22 have a ratio of 16:12=4:316:12=4:3;  Ingredients 11 and 44 have a ratio of 16:32=2:416:32=2:4. In the second test case, the amounts of ingredients 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,81,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 in the potion that minimizes the total amount of ingredients are 60,60,24,48,32,60,45,3060,60,24,48,32,60,45,30.

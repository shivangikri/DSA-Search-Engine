Madoka is going to enroll in "TSUNS PTU". But she stumbled upon a difficult task during the entrance computer science exam:  A number is called good if it is a multiple of dd.  A number is called beatiful if it is good and it cannot be represented as a product of two good numbers. Notice that a beautiful number must be good.Given a good number xx, determine whether it can be represented in at least two different ways as a product of several (possibly, one) beautiful numbers. Two ways are different if the sets of numbers used are different.Solve this problem for Madoka and help her to enroll in the best school in Russia!
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — number of test cases. Below comes their description.Each test case consists of two integers xx and dd, separated by a space (2≤x,d≤1092≤x,d≤109). It is guaranteed that xx is a multiple of dd.
OutputFor each set of input data, output "NO" if the number cannot be represented in at least two ways. Otherwise, output "YES".You can output each letter in any case (for example, "YES", "Yes", "yes", "yEs", "yEs" will be recognized as a positive answer).

NoteIn the first example, 66 can be represented as 66, 1⋅61⋅6, 2⋅32⋅3. But 33 and 11 are not a good numbers because they are not divisible by 22, so there is only one way.In the second example, 1212 can be represented as 6⋅26⋅2, 1212, 3⋅43⋅4, or 3⋅2⋅23⋅2⋅2. The first option is suitable. The second is— no, because 1212 is not beautiful number (12=6⋅212=6⋅2). The third and fourth are also not suitable, because 33 is not good number.In the third example, 3636 can be represented as 18⋅218⋅2 and 6⋅66⋅6. Therefore it can be decomposed in at least two ways.

You are given an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. You can perform operations on the array. In each operation you can choose an integer ii (1≤i<n1≤i<n), and swap elements aiai and ai+1ai+1 of the array, if ai+ai+1ai+ai+1 is odd.Determine whether it can be sorted in non-decreasing order using this operation any number of times.
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1051≤t≤105) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputFor each test case, print "Yes" or "No" depending on whether you can or can not sort the given array.You may print each letter in any case (for example, "YES", "Yes", "yes", "yEs" will all be recognized as positive answer).

NoteIn the first test case, we can simply swap 3131 and 1414 (31+14=4531+14=45 which is odd) and obtain the non-decreasing array [1,6,14,31][1,6,14,31].In the second test case, the only way we could sort the array is by swapping 44 and 22, but this is impossible, since their sum 4+2=64+2=6 is even.In the third test case, there is no way to make the array non-decreasing.In the fourth test case, the array is already non-decreasing.

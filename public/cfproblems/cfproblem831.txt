Given an array aa of length nn, tell us whether it has a non-empty subsequence such that the product of its elements is not a perfect square.A sequence bb is a subsequence of an array aa if bb can be obtained from aa by deleting some (possibly zero) elements.
InputThe first line contains an integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1≤n≤1001≤n≤100) — the length of the array aa.The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1a1, a2a2, ……, anan (1≤ai≤1041≤ai≤104) — the elements of the array aa.
OutputIf there's a subsequence of aa whose product isn't a perfect square, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

NoteIn the first example, the product of the whole array (2020) isn't a perfect square.In the second example, all subsequences have a perfect square product.

This is an interactive problem.Little Dormi was faced with an awkward problem at the carnival: he has to guess the edges of an unweighted tree of nn nodes! The nodes of the tree are numbered from 11 to nn.The game master only allows him to ask one type of question: Little Dormi picks a node rr (1≤r≤n1≤r≤n), and the game master will reply with an array d1,d2,…,dnd1,d2,…,dn, where didi is the length of the shortest path from node rr to ii, for all 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n.Additionally, to make the game unfair challenge Little Dormi the game master will allow at most ⌈n2⌉⌈n2⌉ questions, where ⌈x⌉⌈x⌉ denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to xx.Faced with the stomach-churning possibility of not being able to guess the tree, Little Dormi needs your help to devise a winning strategy!Note that the game master creates the tree before the game starts, and does not change it during the game.
InputThe first line of input contains the integer nn (2≤n≤20002≤n≤2000), the number of nodes in the tree.You will then begin interaction.
OutputWhen your program has found the tree, first output a line consisting of a single "!" followed by n−1n−1 lines each with two space separated integers aa and bb, denoting an edge connecting nodes aa and bb (1≤a,b≤n1≤a,b≤n). Once you are done, terminate your program normally immediately after flushing the output stream.You may output the edges in any order and an edge (a,b)(a,b) is considered the same as an edge (b,a)(b,a). Answering is not considered as a query.
InteractionAfter taking input, you may make at most ⌈n2⌉⌈n2⌉ queries. Each query is made in the format "? r", where rr is an integer 1≤r≤n1≤r≤n that denotes the node you want to pick for that query.You will then receive nn space separated integers d1,d2,…,dnd1,d2,…,dn, where didi is the length of the shortest path from node rr to ii, followed by a newline.After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:  fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;  System.out.flush() in Java;  flush(output) in Pascal;  stdout.flush() in Python;  see documentation for other languages. If at any point you make an invalid query or try to make more than ⌈n2⌉⌈n2⌉ queries, the interaction will terminate immediately and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.HacksTo hack a solution, use the following format.The first line contains the integer nn (2≤n≤20002≤n≤2000).The next n−1n−1 lines contain two integers uu and vv (1≤u,v≤n1≤u,v≤n) denoting an edge between uu and vv (u≠vu≠v). These n−1n−1 edges must form a tree.

NoteHere is the tree from the first example.  Notice that the edges can be output in any order.Additionally, here are the answers for querying every single node in example 11: 11: [0,1,2,2][0,1,2,2]  22: [1,0,1,1][1,0,1,1]  33: [2,1,0,2][2,1,0,2]  44: [2,1,2,0][2,1,2,0]Below is the tree from the second example interaction.  Lastly, here are the answers for querying every single node in example 22: 11: [0,4,1,3,2][0,4,1,3,2]  22: [4,0,3,1,2][4,0,3,1,2]  33: [1,3,0,2,1][1,3,0,2,1]  44: [3,1,2,0,1][3,1,2,0,1]  55: [2,2,1,1,0][2,2,1,1,0]

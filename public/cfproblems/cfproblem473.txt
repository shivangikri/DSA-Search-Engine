The problem statement looms below, filling you with determination.Consider a grid in which some cells are empty and some cells are filled. Call a cell in this grid exitable if, starting at that cell, you can exit the grid by moving up and left through only empty cells. This includes the cell itself, so all filled in cells are not exitable. Note that you can exit the grid from any leftmost empty cell (cell in the first column) by going left, and from any topmost empty cell (cell in the first row) by going up.Let's call a grid determinable if, given only which cells are exitable, we can exactly determine which cells are filled in and which aren't.You are given a grid aa of dimensions n×mn×m , i. e. a grid with nn rows and mm columns. You need to answer qq queries (1≤q≤2⋅1051≤q≤2⋅105). Each query gives two integers x1,x2x1,x2 (1≤x1≤x2≤m1≤x1≤x2≤m) and asks whether the subgrid of aa consisting of the columns x1,x1+1,…,x2−1,x2x1,x1+1,…,x2−1,x2 is determinable.
InputThe first line contains two integers n,mn,m (1≤n,m≤1061≤n,m≤106, nm≤106nm≤106)  — the dimensions of the grid aa.nn lines follow. The yy-th line contains mm characters, the xx-th of which is 'X' if the cell on the intersection of the the yy-th row and xx-th column is filled and "." if it is empty.The next line contains a single integer qq (1≤q≤2⋅1051≤q≤2⋅105)  — the number of queries.qq lines follow. Each line contains two integers x1x1 and x2x2 (1≤x1≤x2≤m1≤x1≤x2≤m), representing a query asking whether the subgrid of aa containing the columns x1,x1+1,…,x2−1,x2x1,x1+1,…,x2−1,x2 is determinable.
OutputFor each query, output one line containing "YES" if the subgrid specified by the query is determinable and "NO" otherwise. The output is case insensitive (so "yEs" and "No" will also be accepted).

NoteFor each query of the example, the corresponding subgrid is displayed twice below: first in its input format, then with each cell marked as "E" if it is exitable and "N" otherwise.For the first query: ..X EEN... EEE... EEE... EEEFor the second query: X N. E. E. ENote that you can exit the grid by going left from any leftmost cell (or up from any topmost cell); you do not need to reach the top left corner cell to exit the grid.For the third query: XX NNX. NNX. NNX. NNThis subgrid cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable, because the below grid produces the above "exitability grid" as well: XXXXXXXXFor the fourth query: X N. E. E. EFor the fifth query: ..XXX EENNN...X. EEENN...X. EEENN...X. EEENNThis query is simply the entire grid. It cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable because the below grid produces the above "exitability grid" as well: ..XXX...XX...XX...XX

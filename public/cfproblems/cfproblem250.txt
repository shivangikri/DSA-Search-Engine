There are nn weighted points on the OXOX-axis. The coordinate and the weight of the ii-th point is xixi and wiwi, respectively. All points have distinct coordinates and positive weights. Also, xi<xi+1xi<xi+1 holds for any 1≤i<n1≤i<n. The weighted distance between ii-th point and jj-th point is defined as |xi−xj|⋅(wi+wj)|xi−xj|⋅(wi+wj), where |val||val| denotes the absolute value of valval.You should answer qq queries, where the ii-th query asks the following: Find the minimum weighted distance among all pairs of distinct points among the points in subarray [li,ri][li,ri].
InputThe first line contains 2 integers nn and qq (2≤n≤3⋅105;1≤q≤3⋅105)(2≤n≤3⋅105;1≤q≤3⋅105) — the number of points and the number of queries.Then, nn lines follows, the ii-th of them contains two integers xixi and wiwi (−109≤xi≤109;1≤wi≤109)(−109≤xi≤109;1≤wi≤109) — the coordinate and the weight of the ii-th point.It is guaranteed that the points are given in the increasing order of xx.Then, qq lines follows, the ii-th of them contains two integers lili and riri (1≤li<ri≤n)(1≤li<ri≤n) — the given subarray of the ii-th query.
OutputFor each query output one integer, the minimum weighted distance among all pair of distinct points in the given subarray.

NoteFor the first query, the minimum weighted distance is between points 11 and 33, which is equal to |x1−x3|⋅(w1+w3)=|−2−1|⋅(2+1)=9|x1−x3|⋅(w1+w3)=|−2−1|⋅(2+1)=9.For the second query, the minimum weighted distance is between points 22 and 33, which is equal to |x2−x3|⋅(w2+w3)=|0−1|⋅(10+1)=11|x2−x3|⋅(w2+w3)=|0−1|⋅(10+1)=11.For the fourth query, the minimum weighted distance is between points 33 and 44, which is equal to |x3−x4|⋅(w3+w4)=|1−9|⋅(1+2)=24|x3−x4|⋅(w3+w4)=|1−9|⋅(1+2)=24.

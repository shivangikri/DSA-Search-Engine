You are given an integer nn. You have to apply mm operations to it.In a single operation, you must replace every digit dd of the number with the decimal representation of integer d+1d+1. For example, 19121912 becomes 2102321023 after applying the operation once.You have to find the length of nn after applying mm operations. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 109+7109+7.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤2⋅1051≤t≤2⋅105) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers nn (1≤n≤1091≤n≤109) and mm (1≤m≤2⋅1051≤m≤2⋅105) — the initial number and the number of operations. 
OutputFor each test case output the length of the resulting number modulo 109+7109+7.

Petya has an array of integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. He only likes sorted arrays. Unfortunately, the given array could be arbitrary, so Petya wants to sort it.Petya likes to challenge himself, so he wants to sort array using only 33-cycles. More formally, in one operation he can pick 33 pairwise distinct indices ii, jj, and kk (1≤i,j,k≤n1≤i,j,k≤n) and apply i→j→k→ii→j→k→i cycle to the array aa. It simultaneously places aiai on position jj, ajaj on position kk, and akak on position ii, without changing any other element.For example, if aa is [10,50,20,30,40,60][10,50,20,30,40,60] and he chooses i=2i=2, j=1j=1, k=5k=5, then the array becomes [50–––,40–––,20,30,10–––,60][50_,40_,20,30,10_,60].Petya can apply arbitrary number of 33-cycles (possibly, zero). You are to determine if Petya can sort his array aa, i. e. make it non-decreasing.
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤5⋅1051≤t≤5⋅105). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤5⋅1051≤n≤5⋅105) — the length of the array aa.The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n).It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅1055⋅105.
OutputFor each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if Petya can sort the array aa using 33-cycles, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

NoteIn the 66-th test case Petya can use the 33-cycle 1→3→2→11→3→2→1 to sort the array.In the 77-th test case Petya can apply 1→3→2→11→3→2→1 and make a=[1,4,2,3]a=[1,4,2,3]. Then he can apply 2→4→3→22→4→3→2 and finally sort the array.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. They start with a positive integer nn and take alternating turns doing operations on it. Each turn a player can subtract from nn one of its divisors that isn't 11 or nn. The player who cannot make a move on his/her turn loses. Alice always moves first.Note that they subtract a divisor of the current number in each turn.You are asked to find out who will win the game if both players play optimally.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.Each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1091≤n≤109) — the initial number.
OutputFor each test case output "Alice" if Alice will win the game or "Bob" if Bob will win, if both players play optimally.

NoteIn the first test case, the game ends immediately because Alice cannot make a move.In the second test case, Alice can subtract 22 making n=2n=2, then Bob cannot make a move so Alice wins.In the third test case, Alice can subtract 33 so that n=9n=9. Bob's only move is to subtract 33 and make n=6n=6. Now, Alice can subtract 33 again and n=3n=3. Then Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

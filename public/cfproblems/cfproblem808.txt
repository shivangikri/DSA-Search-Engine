In the 2050 Conference, some people from the competitive programming community meet together and are going to take a photo. The nn people form a line. They are numbered from 11 to nn from left to right. Each of them either holds a cardboard with the letter 'C' or a cardboard with the letter 'P'.Let C={c1,c2,…,cm}C={c1,c2,…,cm} (c1<c2<…<cm)(c1<c2<…<cm) be the set of people who hold cardboards of 'C'. Let P={p1,p2,…,pk}P={p1,p2,…,pk} (p1<p2<…<pk)(p1<p2<…<pk) be the set of people who hold cardboards of 'P'. The photo is good if and only if it satisfies the following constraints:   C∪P={1,2,…,n}C∪P={1,2,…,n}  C∩P=∅C∩P=∅.  ci−ci−1≤ci+1−ci(1<i<m)ci−ci−1≤ci+1−ci(1<i<m).  pi−pi−1≥pi+1−pi(1<i<k)pi−pi−1≥pi+1−pi(1<i<k). Given an array a1,…,ana1,…,an, please find the number of good photos satisfying the following condition: ∑x∈Cax<∑y∈Pay.∑x∈Cax<∑y∈Pay.The answer can be large, so output it modulo 998244353998244353. Two photos are different if and only if there exists at least one person who holds a cardboard of 'C' in one photo but holds a cardboard of 'P' in the other.
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤2000001≤t≤200000). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤2000001≤n≤200000).The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109).It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 200000200000.
OutputFor each test case, output the answer modulo 998244353998244353 in a separate line.

NoteFor the first test case, there are 1010 possible good photos satisfying the condition: PPPPP, CPPPP, PCPPP, CCPPP, PCCPP, PCPCP, PPPPC, CPPPC, PCPPC, PPPCC.For the second test case, there are 77 possible good photos satisfying the condition: PPPP, PCPP, PCCP, PPPC, PCPC, PPCC, PCCC.

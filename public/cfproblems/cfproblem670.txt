You are given an array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an consisting of nn distinct integers. Count the number of pairs of indices (i,j)(i,j) such that i<ji<j and ai⋅aj=i+jai⋅aj=i+j.
InputThe first line contains one integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then tt cases follow.The first line of each test case contains one integer nn (2≤n≤1052≤n≤105) — the length of array aa.The second line of each test case contains nn space separated integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤2⋅n1≤ai≤2⋅n) — the array aa. It is guaranteed that all elements are distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputFor each test case, output the number of pairs of indices (i,j)(i,j) such that i<ji<j and ai⋅aj=i+jai⋅aj=i+j.

NoteFor the first test case, the only pair that satisfies the constraints is (1,2)(1,2), as a1⋅a2=1+2=3a1⋅a2=1+2=3For the second test case, the only pair that satisfies the constraints is (2,3)(2,3).For the third test case, the pairs that satisfy the constraints are (1,2)(1,2), (1,5)(1,5), and (2,3)(2,3).

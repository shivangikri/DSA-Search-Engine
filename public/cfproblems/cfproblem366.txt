  William has array of nn numbers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. He can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:   Pick any two items from array aiai and ajaj, where aiai must be a multiple of 22  ai=ai2ai=ai2  aj=aj⋅2aj=aj⋅2 Help William find the maximal sum of array elements, which he can get by performing the sequence of operations described above.
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104). Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1≤n≤15)(1≤n≤15), the number of elements in William's array.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai<16)(1≤ai<16), the contents of William's array.
OutputFor each test case output the maximal sum of array elements after performing an optimal sequence of operations.

NoteIn the first example test case the optimal sequence would be:   Pick i=2i=2 and j=1j=1. After performing a sequence of operations a2=42=2a2=42=2 and a1=6⋅2=12a1=6⋅2=12, making the array look as: [12, 2, 2].  Pick i=2i=2 and j=1j=1. After performing a sequence of operations a2=22=1a2=22=1 and a1=12⋅2=24a1=12⋅2=24, making the array look as: [24, 1, 2].  Pick i=3i=3 and j=1j=1. After performing a sequence of operations a3=22=1a3=22=1 and a1=24⋅2=48a1=24⋅2=48, making the array look as: [48, 1, 1]. The final answer 48+1+1=5048+1+1=50.In the third example test case there is no way to change the sum of elements, so the answer is 1010.

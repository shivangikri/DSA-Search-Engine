British mathematician John Littlewood once said about Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan that "every positive integer was one of his personal friends."It turns out that positive integers can also be friends with each other! You are given an array aa of distinct positive integers. Define a subarray ai,ai+1,…,ajai,ai+1,…,aj to be a friend group if and only if there exists an integer m≥2m≥2 such that aimodm=ai+1modm=…=ajmodmaimodm=ai+1modm=…=ajmodm, where xmodyxmody denotes the remainder when xx is divided by yy.Your friend Gregor wants to know the size of the largest friend group in aa.
InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤2⋅1041≤t≤2⋅104). Each test case begins with a line containing the integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105), the size of the array aa.The next line contains nn positive integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤10181≤ai≤1018), representing the contents of the array aa. It is guaranteed that all the numbers in aa are distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases is less than 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputYour output should consist of tt lines. Each line should consist of a single integer, the size of the largest friend group in aa.

NoteIn the first test case, the array is [1,5,2,4,6][1,5,2,4,6]. The largest friend group is [2,4,6][2,4,6], since all those numbers are congruent to 00 modulo 22, so m=2m=2.In the second test case, the array is [8,2,5,10][8,2,5,10]. The largest friend group is [8,2,5][8,2,5], since all those numbers are congruent to 22 modulo 33, so m=3m=3.In the third case, the largest friend group is [1000,2000][1000,2000]. There are clearly many possible values of mm that work.

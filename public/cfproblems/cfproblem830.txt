Baby Badawy's first words were "AND 0 SUM BIG", so he decided to solve the following problem. Given two integers nn and kk, count the number of arrays of length nn such that:  all its elements are integers between 00 and 2k−12k−1 (inclusive);  the bitwise AND of all its elements is 00;  the sum of its elements is as large as possible. Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder when divided by 109+7109+7.
InputThe first line contains an integer tt (1≤t≤101≤t≤10) — the number of test cases you need to solve.Each test case consists of a line containing two integers nn and kk (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105, 1≤k≤201≤k≤20).
OutputFor each test case, print the number of arrays satisfying the conditions. Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder when divided by 109+7109+7.

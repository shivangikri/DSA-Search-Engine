Two painters, Amin and Benj, are repainting Gregor's living room ceiling! The ceiling can be modeled as an n×mn×m grid.For each ii between 11 and nn, inclusive, painter Amin applies aiai layers of paint to the entire ii-th row. For each jj between 11 and mm, inclusive, painter Benj applies bjbj layers of paint to the entire jj-th column. Therefore, the cell (i,j)(i,j) ends up with ai+bjai+bj layers of paint.Gregor considers the cell (i,j)(i,j) to be badly painted if ai+bj≤xai+bj≤x. Define a badly painted region to be a maximal connected component of badly painted cells, i. e. a connected component of badly painted cells such that all adjacent to the component cells are not badly painted. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.Gregor is appalled by the state of the finished ceiling, and wants to know the number of badly painted regions.
InputThe first line contains three integers nn, mm and xx (1≤n,m≤2⋅1051≤n,m≤2⋅105, 1≤x≤2⋅1051≤x≤2⋅105) — the dimensions of Gregor's ceiling, and the maximum number of paint layers in a badly painted cell.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤2⋅1051≤ai≤2⋅105), the number of paint layers Amin applies to each row.The third line contains mm integers b1,b2,…,bmb1,b2,…,bm (1≤bj≤2⋅1051≤bj≤2⋅105), the number of paint layers Benj applies to each column.
OutputPrint a single integer, the number of badly painted regions.

NoteThe diagram below represents the first example. The numbers to the left of each row represent the list aa, and the numbers above each column represent the list bb. The numbers inside each cell represent the number of paint layers in that cell.The colored cells correspond to badly painted cells. The red and blue cells respectively form 22 badly painted regions.

Let's call an array aa consisting of nn positive (greater than 00) integers beautiful if the following condition is held for every ii from 11 to nn: either ai=1ai=1, or at least one of the numbers ai−1ai−1 and ai−2ai−2 exists in the array as well.For example:   the array [5,3,1][5,3,1] is beautiful: for a1a1, the number a1−2=3a1−2=3 exists in the array; for a2a2, the number a2−2=1a2−2=1 exists in the array; for a3a3, the condition a3=1a3=1 holds;  the array [1,2,2,2,2][1,2,2,2,2] is beautiful: for a1a1, the condition a1=1a1=1 holds; for every other number aiai, the number ai−1=1ai−1=1 exists in the array;  the array [1,4][1,4] is not beautiful: for a2a2, neither a2−2=2a2−2=2 nor a2−1=3a2−1=3 exists in the array, and a2≠1a2≠1;  the array [2][2] is not beautiful: for a1a1, neither a1−1=1a1−1=1 nor a1−2=0a1−2=0 exists in the array, and a1≠1a1≠1;  the array [2,1,3][2,1,3] is beautiful: for a1a1, the number a1−1=1a1−1=1 exists in the array; for a2a2, the condition a2=1a2=1 holds; for a3a3, the number a3−2=1a3−2=1 exists in the array. You are given a positive integer ss. Find the minimum possible size of a beautiful array with the sum of elements equal to ss.
InputThe first line contains one integer tt (1≤t≤50001≤t≤5000) — the number of test cases.Then tt lines follow, the ii-th line contains one integer ss (1≤s≤50001≤s≤5000) for the ii-th test case.
OutputPrint tt integers, the ii-th integer should be the answer for the ii-th testcase: the minimum possible size of a beautiful array with the sum of elements equal to ss.

NoteConsider the example test:  in the first test case, the array [1][1] meets all conditions;  in the second test case, the array [3,4,1][3,4,1] meets all conditions;  in the third test case, the array [1,2,4][1,2,4] meets all conditions;  in the fourth test case, the array [1,4,6,8,10,2,11][1,4,6,8,10,2,11] meets all conditions.

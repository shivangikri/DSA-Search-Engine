A sequence of nn integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 11 to nn exactly once.Given two integers nn and kk, construct a permutation aa of numbers from 11 to nn which has exactly kk peaks. An index ii of an array aa of size nn is said to be a peak if 1<i<n1<i<n and ai>ai−1ai>ai−1 and ai>ai+1ai>ai+1. If such permutation is not possible, then print −1−1.
InputThe first line contains an integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.Then tt lines follow, each containing two space-separated integers nn (1≤n≤1001≤n≤100) and kk (0≤k≤n0≤k≤n) — the length of an array and the required number of peaks.
OutputOutput tt lines. For each test case, if there is no permutation with given length and number of peaks, then print −1−1. Otherwise print a line containing nn space-separated integers which forms a permutation of numbers from 11 to nn and contains exactly kk peaks. If there are multiple answers, print any.

NoteIn the second test case of the example, we have array a=[2,4,1,5,3]a=[2,4,1,5,3]. Here, indices i=2i=2 and i=4i=4 are the peaks of the array. This is because (a2>a1(a2>a1, a2>a3)a2>a3) and (a4>a3(a4>a3, a4>a5)a4>a5).

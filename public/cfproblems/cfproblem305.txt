Binary Spiders are species of spiders that live on Mars. These spiders weave their webs to defend themselves from enemies.To weave a web, spiders join in pairs. If the first spider in pair has xx legs, and the second spider has yy legs, then they weave a web with durability x⊕yx⊕y. Here, ⊕⊕ means bitwise XOR.Binary Spiders live in large groups. You observe a group of nn spiders, and the ii-th spider has aiai legs.When the group is threatened, some of the spiders become defenders. Defenders are chosen in the following way. First, there must be at least two defenders. Second, any pair of defenders must be able to weave a web with durability at least kk. Third, there must be as much defenders as possible.Scientists have researched the behaviour of Binary Spiders for a long time, and now they have a hypothesis that they can always choose the defenders in an optimal way, satisfying the conditions above. You need to verify this hypothesis on your group of spiders. So, you need to understand how many spiders must become defenders. You are not a Binary Spider, so you decided to use a computer to solve this problem.
InputThe first line contains two integers nn and kk (2≤n≤3⋅1052≤n≤3⋅105, 0≤k≤230−10≤k≤230−1), the amount of spiders in the group and the minimal allowed durability of a web.The second line contains nn integers aiai (0≤ai≤230−10≤ai≤230−1) — the number of legs the ii-th spider has.
OutputIn the first line, print a single integer ℓℓ (2≤ℓ≤n2≤ℓ≤n), the maximum possible amount of defenders.In the second line, print ℓℓ integers bibi, separated by a single space (1≤bi≤n1≤bi≤n) — indices of spiders that will become defenders.If there exists more than one way to choose the defenders, print any of them.Unfortunately, it may appear that it's impossible to choose the defenders. In this case, print a single integer −1−1.

NoteConsider the examples above.In the first example, the group of spiders is illustrated on the picture below:  We choose the two-legged, the ten-legged and the 1616-legged spiders. It's not hard to see that each pair may weave a web with enough durability, as 2⊕10=8≥82⊕10=8≥8, 2⊕16=18≥82⊕16=18≥8 and 10⊕16=26≥810⊕16=26≥8.This is not the only way, as you can also choose, for example, the spiders with indices 33, 44, and 66.In the second example, no pair of spiders can weave the web with durability 10241024 or more, so the answer is −1−1.

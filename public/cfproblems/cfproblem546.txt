A binary string is a string that consists of characters 00 and 11. A bi-table is a table that has exactly two rows of equal length, each being a binary string.Let MEXMEX of a bi-table be the smallest digit among 00, 11, or 22 that does not occur in the bi-table. For example, MEXMEX for [00111010][00111010] is 22, because 00 and 11 occur in the bi-table at least once. MEXMEX for [111111][111111] is 00, because 00 and 22 do not occur in the bi-table, and 0<20<2.You are given a bi-table with nn columns. You should cut it into any number of bi-tables (each consisting of consecutive columns) so that each column is in exactly one bi-table. It is possible to cut the bi-table into a single bi-table — the whole bi-table.What is the maximal sum of MEXMEX of all resulting bi-tables can be?
InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105) — the number of columns in the bi-table.Each of the next two lines contains a binary string of length nn — the rows of the bi-table.It's guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.
OutputFor each test case print a single integer — the maximal sum of MEXMEX of all bi-tables that it is possible to get by cutting the given bi-table optimally.

NoteIn the first test case you can cut the bi-table as follows:  [01][01], its MEXMEX is 22. [1010][1010], its MEXMEX is 22. [11][11], its MEXMEX is 00. [01][01], its MEXMEX is 22. [00][00], its MEXMEX is 11. [00][00], its MEXMEX is 11.The sum of MEXMEX is 88.

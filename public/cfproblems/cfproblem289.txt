Mihai plans to watch a movie. He only likes palindromic movies, so he wants to skip some (possibly zero) scenes to make the remaining parts of the movie palindromic.You are given a list ss of nn non-empty strings of length at most 33, representing the scenes of Mihai's movie.A subsequence of ss is called awesome if it is non-empty and the concatenation of the strings in the subsequence, in order, is a palindrome.Can you help Mihai check if there is at least one awesome subsequence of ss?A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, for example strings "z", "aaa", "aba", "abccba" are palindromes, but strings "codeforces", "reality", "ab" are not.A sequence aa is a non-empty subsequence of a non-empty sequence bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly zero, but not all) elements.
InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105) — the number of scenes in the movie.Then follows nn lines, the ii-th of which containing a single non-empty string sisi of length at most 33, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.
OutputFor each test case, print "YES" if there is an awesome subsequence of ss, or "NO" otherwise (case insensitive).

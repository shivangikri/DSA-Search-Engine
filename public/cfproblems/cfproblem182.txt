Recently, your friend discovered one special operation on an integer array aa:   Choose two indices ii and jj (i≠ji≠j);  Set ai=aj=|ai−aj|ai=aj=|ai−aj|. After playing with this operation for a while, he came to the next conclusion:   For every array aa of nn integers, where 1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109, you can find a pair of indices (i,j)(i,j) such that the total sum of aa will decrease after performing the operation. This statement sounds fishy to you, so you want to find a counterexample for a given integer nn. Can you find such counterexample and prove him wrong?In other words, find an array aa consisting of nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) such that for all pairs of indices (i,j)(i,j) performing the operation won't decrease the total sum (it will increase or not change the sum).
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer nn (2≤n≤10002≤n≤1000) — the length of array aa.
OutputFor each test case, if there is no counterexample array aa of size nn, print NO.Otherwise, print YES followed by the array aa itself (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109). If there are multiple counterexamples, print any.

NoteIn the first test case, the only possible pairs of indices are (1,2)(1,2) and (2,1)(2,1).If you perform the operation on indices (1,2)(1,2) (or (2,1)(2,1)), you'll get a1=a2=|1−337|=336a1=a2=|1−337|=336, or array [336,336][336,336]. In both cases, the total sum increases, so this array aa is a counterexample.

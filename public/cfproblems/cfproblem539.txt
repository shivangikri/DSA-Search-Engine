Alice has a grid with 22 rows and nn columns. She fully covers the grid using nn dominoes of size 1×21×2 — Alice may place them vertically or horizontally, and each cell should be covered by exactly one domino.Now, she decided to show one row of the grid to Bob. Help Bob and figure out what the other row of the grid looks like!
InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1≤t≤50001≤t≤5000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1≤n≤1001≤n≤100) — the width of the grid.The second line of each test case contains a string ss consisting of nn characters, each of which is either L, R, U, or D, representing the left, right, top, or bottom half of a domino, respectively (see notes for better understanding). This string represents one of the rows of the grid. Additional constraint on the input: each input corresponds to at least one valid tiling.
OutputFor each test case, output one string — the other row of the grid, using the same format as the input string. If there are multiple answers, print any.

You are given an undirected graph of NN nodes and MM edges, E1,E2,…EME1,E2,…EM.A connected graph is a cactus if each of it's edges belogs to at most one simple cycle. A graph is a desert if each of it's connected components is a cactus. Find the number of pairs (L,R)(L,R), (1≤L≤R≤M1≤L≤R≤M) such that, if we delete all the edges except for EL,EL+1,…EREL,EL+1,…ER, the graph is a desert. 
InputThe first line contains two integers NN and MM (2≤N≤2.5×1052≤N≤2.5×105, 1≤M≤5×1051≤M≤5×105). Each of the next MM lines contains two integers. The ii-th line describes the ii-th edge. It contains integers UiUi and ViVi, the nodes connected by the ii-th edge (Ei=(Ui,Vi)Ei=(Ui,Vi)). It is guaranteed that 1≤Ui,Vi≤N1≤Ui,Vi≤N and Ui≠ViUi≠Vi. 
OutputThe output contains one integer number – the answer.

NoteIn the second example: Graphs for pairs (1,1)(1,1), (2,2)(2,2) and (3,3)(3,3) are deserts because they don't have any cycles. Graphs for pairs (1,2)(1,2) and (2,3)(2,3) have one cycle of length 2 so they are deserts.

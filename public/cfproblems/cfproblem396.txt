It was October 18, 2017. Shohag, a melancholic soul, made a strong determination that he will pursue Competitive Programming seriously, by heart, because he found it fascinating. Fast forward to 4 years, he is happy that he took this road. He is now creating a contest on Codeforces. He found an astounding problem but has no idea how to solve this. Help him to solve the final problem of the round.You are given three integers nn, kk and xx. Find the number, modulo 998244353998244353, of integer sequences a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an such that the following conditions are satisfied:   0≤ai<2k0≤ai<2k for each integer ii from 11 to nn.  There is no non-empty subsequence in aa such that the bitwise XOR of the elements of the subsequence is xx. A sequence bb is a subsequence of a sequence cc if bb can be obtained from cc by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1051≤t≤105)  — the number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers nn, kk, and xx (1≤n≤1091≤n≤109, 0≤k≤1070≤k≤107, 0≤x<2min(20,k)0≤x<2min⁡(20,k)).It is guaranteed that the sum of kk over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅1075⋅107.
OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

NoteIn the first test case, the valid sequences are [1,2][1,2], [1,3][1,3], [2,1][2,1], [2,3][2,3], [3,1][3,1] and [3,2][3,2].In the second test case, the only valid sequence is [0,0][0,0].

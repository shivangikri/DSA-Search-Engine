Your friend has created a nearest point function. For a given array of integer points xx (sorted in ascending order, without any duplicates) and a point yy it can find the nearest point from xx to the point yy. In other words, it will find such a point xixi that |y−xi||y−xi| is the minimum possible, where |a||a| is the absolute value of aa.For example, if x=[1,2,5,7,9,11]x=[1,2,5,7,9,11], the answer for y=3y=3 will be 22, the answer for y=5y=5 will be 55 and the answer for y=100y=100 will be 1111.This function is a bit buggy, though. If there are several nearest points to the given one, the function crashes. For example, if x=[1,2,5,7,9,11]x=[1,2,5,7,9,11] (as above) and y=6y=6, the function will crash, since points 55 and 77 are both the nearest points for 66.Your task is, for a given array of integer points xx (sorted in ascending order, without any duplicates), determine if it is possible to cause the function to crash by choosing some integer point yy.You have to answer tt independent test cases.
InputThe first line of the input contains one integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.The first line of the test case contains one integer nn (2≤n≤2⋅1052≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of points in the array xx.The second line of the test case contains nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn (1≤xi≤1091≤xi≤109), where xixi is the ii-th point in the array xx.All points in the array xx are distinct, and the array xx is sorted in ascending order (in other words, x1<x2<…<xnx1<x2<…<xn).The sum of nn over the test cases in the input does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105 (∑n≤2⋅105∑n≤2⋅105).
OutputFor each test case, print YES if it is possible to find some integer point yy that will crash the function and NO otherwise.

NoteIn the first test case of the example, the function crashes if y=2y=2 is chosen.In the fifth test case of the example, the function crashes if y=500000000y=500000000 is chosen.In the sixth test case of the example, the function crashes if y=10y=10 is chosen.

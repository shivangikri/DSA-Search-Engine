Bob decided to take a break from calculus homework and designed a game for himself. The game is played on a sequence of piles of stones, which can be described with a sequence of integers s1,…,sks1,…,sk, where sisi is the number of stones in the ii-th pile. On each turn, Bob picks a pair of non-empty adjacent piles ii and i+1i+1 and takes one stone from each. If a pile becomes empty, its adjacent piles do not become adjacent. The game ends when Bob can't make turns anymore. Bob considers himself a winner if at the end all piles are empty.We consider a sequence of piles winning if Bob can start with it and win with some sequence of moves.You are given a sequence a1,…,ana1,…,an, count the number of subsegments of aa that describe a winning sequence of piles. In other words find the number of segments [l,r][l,r] (1≤l≤r≤n1≤l≤r≤n), such that the sequence al,al+1,…,aral,al+1,…,ar is winning.
InputEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤3⋅1051≤t≤3⋅105) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤3⋅1051≤n≤3⋅105).The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤1090≤ai≤109).It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅1053⋅105.
OutputPrint a single integer for each test case — the answer to the problem.

NoteIn the first test case, Bob can't win on subsegments of length 11, as there is no pair of adjacent piles in an array of length 11.In the second test case, every subsegment is not winning.In the fourth test case, the subsegment [1,4][1,4] is winning, because Bob can make moves with pairs of adjacent piles: (2,3)(2,3), (1,2)(1,2), (3,4)(3,4). Another winning subsegment is [2,3][2,3].

Let's call a permutation pp of length nn anti-Fibonacci if the condition pi−2+pi−1≠pipi−2+pi−1≠pi holds for all ii (3≤i≤n3≤i≤n). Recall that the permutation is the array of length nn which contains each integer from 11 to nn exactly once.Your task is for a given number nn print nn distinct anti-Fibonacci permutations of length nn.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤481≤t≤48) — the number of test cases. The single line of each test case contains a single integer nn (3≤n≤503≤n≤50).
OutputFor each test case, print nn lines. Each line should contain an anti-Fibonacci permutation of length nn. In each test case, you cannot print any permutation more than once.If there are multiple answers, print any of them. It can be shown that it is always possible to find nn different anti-Fibonacci permutations of size nn under the constraints of the problem.

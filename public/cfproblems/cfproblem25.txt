Given an array aa of length nn and an integer kk, you are tasked to find any two numbers ll and rr (l≤rl≤r) such that:   For each xx (l≤x≤r)(l≤x≤r), xx appears in aa at least kk times (i.e. kk or more array elements are equal to xx).  The value r−lr−l is maximized. If no numbers satisfy the conditions, output -1.For example, if a=[11,11,12,13,13,14,14]a=[11,11,12,13,13,14,14] and k=2k=2, then:   for l=12l=12, r=14r=14 the first condition fails because 1212 does not appear at least k=2k=2 times.  for l=13l=13, r=14r=14 the first condition holds, because 1313 occurs at least k=2k=2 times in aa and 1414 occurs at least k=2k=2 times in aa.  for l=11l=11, r=11r=11 the first condition holds, because 1111 occurs at least k=2k=2 times in aa. A pair of ll and rr for which the first condition holds and r−lr−l is maximal is l=13l=13, r=14r=14.
InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤10001≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains the integers nn and kk (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105, 1≤k≤n1≤k≤n) — the length of the array aa and the minimum amount of times each number in the range [l,r][l,r] should appear respectively.Then a single line follows, containing nn integers describing the array aa (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109).It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputFor each test case output 22 numbers, ll and rr that satisfy the conditions, or "-1" if no numbers satisfy the conditions.If multiple answers exist, you can output any.

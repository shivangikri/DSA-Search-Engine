Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.A level is a rectangular grid of 22 rows and nn columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell (1,1)(1,1) — at the intersection of the 11-st row and the 11-st column.Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell (x1,y1)(x1,y1) to cell (x2,y2)(x2,y2) in one step if |x1−x2|≤1|x1−x2|≤1 and |y1−y2|≤1|y1−y2|≤1. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell (2,n)(2,n) — at the intersection of row 22 and column nn.Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.The first line contains a single integer nn (3≤n≤1003≤n≤100) — the number of columns.The next two lines describe the level. The ii-th of these lines describes the ii-th line of the level — the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.Additional constraint on the input: cells (1,1)(1,1) and (2,n)(2,n) are safe.
OutputFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.

NoteConsider the example from the statement.In the first test case, one of the possible paths is (1,1)→(2,2)→(2,3)(1,1)→(2,2)→(2,3).In the second test case, one of the possible paths is (1,1)→(1,2)→(2,3)→(2,4)(1,1)→(1,2)→(2,3)→(2,4).In the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is (1,1)→(2,2)→(1,3)→(2,4)→(1,5)→(2,6)(1,1)→(2,2)→(1,3)→(2,4)→(1,5)→(2,6).

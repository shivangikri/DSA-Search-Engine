There are nn cities numbered from 11 to nn, and city ii has beauty aiai.A salesman wants to start at city 11, visit every city exactly once, and return to city 11.For all i≠ji≠j, a flight from city ii to city jj costs max(ci,aj−ai)max(ci,aj−ai) dollars, where cici is the price floor enforced by city ii. Note that there is no absolute value. Find the minimum total cost for the salesman to complete his trip.
InputThe first line contains a single integer nn (2≤n≤1052≤n≤105) — the number of cities.The ii-th of the next nn lines contains two integers aiai, cici (0≤ai,ci≤1090≤ai,ci≤109) — the beauty and price floor of the ii-th city.
OutputOutput a single integer — the minimum total cost.

NoteIn the first test case, we can travel in order 1→3→2→11→3→2→1.   The flight 1→31→3 costs max(c1,a3−a1)=max(9,4−1)=9max(c1,a3−a1)=max(9,4−1)=9.  The flight 3→23→2 costs max(c3,a2−a3)=max(1,2−4)=1max(c3,a2−a3)=max(1,2−4)=1.  The flight 2→12→1 costs max(c2,a1−a2)=max(1,1−2)=1max(c2,a1−a2)=max(1,1−2)=1. The total cost is 1111, and we cannot do better.

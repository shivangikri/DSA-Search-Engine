Annie has gotten bored of winning every coding contest and farming unlimited rating. Today, she is going to farm potatoes instead.Annie's garden is an infinite 2D plane. She has nn potatoes to plant, and the ii-th potato must be planted at (xi,yi)(xi,yi). Starting at the point (0,0)(0,0), Annie begins walking, in one step she can travel one unit right or up (increasing her xx or yy coordinate by 11 respectively). At any point (X,Y)(X,Y) during her walk she can plant some potatoes at arbitrary points using her potato gun, consuming max(|X−x|,|Y−y|)max(|X−x|,|Y−y|) units of energy in order to plant a potato at (x,y)(x,y). Find the minimum total energy required to plant every potato.Note that Annie may plant any number of potatoes from any point.
InputThe first line contains the integer nn (1≤n≤8000001≤n≤800000).The next nn lines contain two integers xixi and yiyi (0≤xi,yi≤1090≤xi,yi≤109), representing the location of the ii-th potato. It is possible that some potatoes should be planted in the same location.
OutputPrint the minimum total energy to plant all potatoes.

NoteIn example 11, Annie can travel to each spot directly and plant a potato with no energy required.In example 22, moving to (1,0)(1,0), Annie plants the second potato using 11 energy. Next, she travels to (1,1)(1,1) and plants the first potato with 00 energy.

You have a card deck of nn cards, numbered from top to bottom, i. e. the top card has index 11 and bottom card — index nn. Each card has its color: the ii-th card has color aiai.You should process qq queries. The jj-th query is described by integer tjtj. For each query you should:   find the highest card in the deck with color tjtj, i. e. the card with minimum index;  print the position of the card you found;  take the card and place it on top of the deck. 
InputThe first line contains two integers nn and qq (2≤n≤3⋅1052≤n≤3⋅105; 1≤q≤3⋅1051≤q≤3⋅105) — the number of cards in the deck and the number of queries.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤501≤ai≤50) — the colors of cards.The third line contains qq integers t1,t2,…,tqt1,t2,…,tq (1≤tj≤501≤tj≤50) — the query colors. It's guaranteed that queries ask only colors that are present in the deck.
OutputPrint qq integers — the answers for each query.

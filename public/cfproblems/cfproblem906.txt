You are given two strings xx and yy, both consist only of lowercase Latin letters. Let |s||s| be the length of string ss.Let's call a sequence aa a merging sequence if it consists of exactly |x||x| zeros and exactly |y||y| ones in some order.A merge zz is produced from a sequence aa by the following rules:   if ai=0ai=0, then remove a letter from the beginning of xx and append it to the end of zz;  if ai=1ai=1, then remove a letter from the beginning of yy and append it to the end of zz. Two merging sequences aa and bb are different if there is some position ii such that ai≠biai≠bi.Let's call a string zz chaotic if for all ii from 22 to |z||z| zi−1≠zizi−1≠zi.Let s[l,r]s[l,r] for some 1≤l≤r≤|s|1≤l≤r≤|s| be a substring of consecutive letters of ss, starting from position ll and ending at position rr inclusive.Let f(l1,r1,l2,r2)f(l1,r1,l2,r2) be the number of different merging sequences of x[l1,r1]x[l1,r1] and y[l2,r2]y[l2,r2] that produce chaotic merges. Note that only non-empty substrings of xx and yy are considered.Calculate ∑1≤l1≤r1≤|x|1≤l2≤r2≤|y|f(l1,r1,l2,r2)∑1≤l1≤r1≤|x|1≤l2≤r2≤|y|f(l1,r1,l2,r2). Output the answer modulo 998244353998244353.
InputThe first line contains a string xx (1≤|x|≤10001≤|x|≤1000).The second line contains a string yy (1≤|y|≤10001≤|y|≤1000).Both strings consist only of lowercase Latin letters.
OutputPrint a single integer — the sum of f(l1,r1,l2,r2)f(l1,r1,l2,r2) over 1≤l1≤r1≤|x|1≤l1≤r1≤|x| and 1≤l2≤r2≤|y|1≤l2≤r2≤|y| modulo 998244353998244353.

NoteIn the first example there are:   66 pairs of substrings "a" and "b", each with valid merging sequences "01" and "10";  33 pairs of substrings "a" and "bb", each with a valid merging sequence "101";  44 pairs of substrings "aa" and "b", each with a valid merging sequence "010";  22 pairs of substrings "aa" and "bb", each with valid merging sequences "0101" and "1010";  22 pairs of substrings "aaa" and "b", each with no valid merging sequences;  11 pair of substrings "aaa" and "bb" with a valid merging sequence "01010"; Thus, the answer is 6⋅2+3⋅1+4⋅1+2⋅2+2⋅0+1⋅1=246⋅2+3⋅1+4⋅1+2⋅2+2⋅0+1⋅1=24.

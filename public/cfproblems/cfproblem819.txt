Phoenix loves playing with bits — specifically, by using the bitwise operations AND, OR, and XOR. He has nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an, and will perform qq of the following queries:  replace all numbers aiai where l≤ai≤rl≤ai≤r with aiai AND xx;  replace all numbers aiai where l≤ai≤rl≤ai≤r with aiai OR xx;  replace all numbers aiai where l≤ai≤rl≤ai≤r with aiai XOR xx;  output how many distinct integers aiai where l≤ai≤rl≤ai≤r. For each query, Phoenix is given ll, rr, and xx. Note that he is considering the values of the numbers, not their indices.
InputThe first line contains two integers nn and qq (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105; 1≤q≤1051≤q≤105) — the number of integers and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (0≤ai<2200≤ai<220) — the integers that Phoenix starts with.The next qq lines contain the queries. For each query, the first integer of each line is tt (1≤t≤41≤t≤4) — the type of query.If t∈{1,2,3}t∈{1,2,3}, then three integers lili, riri, and xixi will follow (0≤li,ri,xi<2200≤li,ri,xi<220; li≤rili≤ri).Otherwise, if t=4t=4, two integers lili and riri will follow (0≤li≤ri<2200≤li≤ri<220).It is guaranteed that there is at least one query where t=4t=4.
OutputPrint the answer for each query where t=4t=4.

NoteIn the first example:  For the first query, 22 is replaced by 22 AND 2=22=2 and 33 is replaced with 33 AND 2=22=2. The set of numbers is {1,2,4,5}{1,2,4,5}. For the second query, there are 33 distinct numbers between 22 and 55: 22, 44, and 55. For the third query, 22 is replaced by 22 XOR 3=13=1, 44 is replaced by 44 XOR 3=73=7, and 55 is replaced by 55 XOR 3=63=6. The set of numbers is {1,6,7}{1,6,7}. For the fourth query, there are 22 distinct numbers between 11 and 66: 11 and 66. For the fifth query, 11 is replaced by 11 OR 8=98=9. The set of numbers is {6,7,9}{6,7,9}. For the sixth query, there is one distinct number between 88 and 1010: 99.

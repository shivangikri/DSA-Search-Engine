The numbers 1,2,…,n⋅k1,2,…,n⋅k are colored with nn colors. These colors are indexed by 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. For each 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n, there are exactly kk numbers colored with color ii.Let [a,b][a,b] denote the interval of integers between aa and bb inclusive, that is, the set {a,a+1,…,b}{a,a+1,…,b}. You must choose nn intervals [a1,b1],[a2,b2],…,[an,bn][a1,b1],[a2,b2],…,[an,bn] such that:   for each 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n, it holds 1≤ai<bi≤n⋅k1≤ai<bi≤n⋅k;  for each 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n, the numbers aiai and bibi are colored with color ii;  each number 1≤x≤n⋅k1≤x≤n⋅k belongs to at most ⌈nk−1⌉⌈nk−1⌉ intervals. One can show that such a family of intervals always exists under the given constraints.
InputThe first line contains two integers nn and kk (1≤n≤1001≤n≤100, 2≤k≤1002≤k≤100) — the number of colors and the number of occurrences of each color.The second line contains n⋅kn⋅k integers c1,c2,…,cnkc1,c2,…,cnk (1≤cj≤n1≤cj≤n), where cjcj is the color of number jj. It is guaranteed that, for each 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n, it holds cj=icj=i for exactly kk distinct indices jj.
OutputOutput nn lines. The ii-th line should contain the two integers aiai and bibi.If there are multiple valid choices of the intervals, output any.

NoteIn the first sample, each number can be contained in at most ⌈43−1⌉=2⌈43−1⌉=2 intervals. The output is described by the following picture:  In the second sample, the only interval to be chosen is forced to be [1,2][1,2], and each number is indeed contained in at most ⌈12−1⌉=1⌈12−1⌉=1 interval.In the third sample, each number can be contained in at most ⌈33−1⌉=2⌈33−1⌉=2 intervals. The output is described by the following picture:

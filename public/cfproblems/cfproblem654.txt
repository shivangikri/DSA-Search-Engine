Cirno gives AquaMoon a problem. There are mm people numbered from 00 to m−1m−1. They are standing on a coordinate axis in points with positive integer coordinates. They are facing right (i.e. in the direction of the coordinate increase). At this moment everyone will start running with the constant speed in the direction of coordinate increasing. The initial coordinate of the ii-th person on the line is xixi, and the speed of the ii-th person is vivi. So the coordinate of the ii-th person at the moment tt will be xi+t⋅vixi+t⋅vi.Cirno captured the coordinates of mm people in kk consecutive integer moments from 00 to k−1k−1. In every moment, the coordinates of mm people were recorded in arbitrary order.To make the problem more funny, Cirno modified one coordinate at the moment yy (0<y<k−10<y<k−1) to a different integer.AquaMoon wants to find the moment yy and the original coordinate pp before the modification. Actually, she is not a programmer at all. So she wasn't able to solve it. Can you help her?
InputThis problem is made as interactive. It means, that your solution will read the input, given by the interactor. But the interactor will give you the full input at the beginning and after that, you should print the answer. So you should solve the problem, like as you solve the usual, non-interactive problem because you won't have any interaction process. The only thing you should not forget is to flush the output buffer, after printing the answer. Otherwise, you can get an "Idleness limit exceeded" verdict. Refer to the interactive problems guide for the detailed information about flushing the output buffer.The first line contains two integers mm and kk (5≤m≤10005≤m≤1000, 7≤k≤10007≤k≤1000) — the number of people and the number of recorded moments. The next kk lines contain captured positions. ii-th of these lines contains mm integers between 11 and 106106 (inclusive), representing positions captured by Cirno at the moment i−1i−1.The input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e. only one integer was modified to a different value according to the problem statement). Also, it is guaranteed, that 1≤vi≤10001≤vi≤1000 for all 1≤i≤m1≤i≤m.Hack format:The first line should contain two integers mm and kk (5≤m≤10005≤m≤1000, 7≤k≤10007≤k≤1000) — the number of people and the number of moments. In the second line, there should be mm integers x0,x1,…,xm−1x0,x1,…,xm−1 (1≤xi≤1061≤xi≤106), where xixi is the initial coordinate of the ii-th person.In the third line, there should be mm integers v0,v1,…,vm−1v0,v1,…,vm−1 (1≤vi≤10001≤vi≤1000), where vivi is the speed of the ii-th person. It should be true that xi+(k−1)vi≤106xi+(k−1)vi≤106 for each 0≤i<m0≤i<m.In the next kk lines, each line should contain mm integers. ii-th line should contain mm distinct integers p0,p1,…,pm−1p0,p1,…,pm−1 (0≤pj<m0≤pj<m). The meaning of these numbers: jj-th integer in the input in the ii-th moment is the coordinate of the pjpj-th person.In the last line, there should be three integers yy, ii, cc. Cirno modified the coordinate of the ii-th person at the moment yy to cc (1≤y≤k−21≤y≤k−2, 0≤i≤m−10≤i≤m−1, 1≤c≤1061≤c≤106, c≠xi+y⋅vic≠xi+y⋅vi).
OutputPrint a single line with two integers yy, pp — the moment that contains the modified coordinate and the original coordinate.

NoteIn the first test the initial coordinates of people are 99, 66, 66, 99, 99 and their speeds are 11, 22, 11, 11, 11. So, it's easy to see, that at the moment 44 one coordinate was modified from 1313 to 1212.This is the first test in the hack format:5 79 6 6 9 91 2 1 1 12 3 4 1 00 2 3 1 44 3 0 1 21 3 4 0 21 4 0 2 32 4 1 3 02 4 1 3 04 0 12

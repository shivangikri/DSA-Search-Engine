Even a cat has things it can do that AI cannot.— Fei-Fei LiYou are given mm arrays of positive integers. Each array is of even length.You need to split all these integers into two equal multisets LL and RR, that is, each element of each array should go into one of two multisets (but not both). Additionally, for each of the mm arrays, exactly half of its elements should go into LL, and the rest should go into RR.Give an example of such a division or determine that no such division exists.
InputThe first line contains an integer mm (1≤m≤1051≤m≤105) — the number of arrays.The next 2⋅m2⋅m lines contain descriptions of the arrays.For each array, the first line contains an even integer nn (2≤n≤2⋅1052≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array. The second line consists of nn space-separated integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109) — array elements.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all arrays does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputIf the answer exists, print "YES", and then print mm lines.On each line, for each element, print the letter "L" or "R" (capitalized, without spaces), depending on which multiset the element should go into.If there is no answer, print "NO" on the only line.

NoteIn the first array, we add the first element to RR and the second to LL. Now L={2}L={2}, and R={1}R={1}.In the second array, we add the first and third elements to LL and the rest to RR. Now L={1,2,3}L={1,2,3} and R={1,2,3}R={1,2,3}.In the third array, we add elements 2, 3, and 6 to LL, and others — to RR. As a result, L=R={1,1,2,2,3,3}L=R={1,1,2,2,3,3}.

You are given a string ss consisting of the characters 0, 1, and ?.Let's call a string unstable if it consists of the characters 0 and 1 and any two adjacent characters are different (i. e. it has the form 010101... or 101010...).Let's call a string beautiful if it consists of the characters 0, 1, and ?, and you can replace the characters ? to 0 or 1 (for each character, the choice is independent), so that the string becomes unstable.For example, the strings 0??10, 0, and ??? are beautiful, and the strings 00 and ?1??1 are not.Calculate the number of beautiful contiguous substrings of the string ss.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — number of test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains the string ss (1≤|s|≤2⋅1051≤|s|≤2⋅105) consisting of characters 0, 1, and ?.It is guaranteed that the sum of the string lengths over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful substrings of the string ss.

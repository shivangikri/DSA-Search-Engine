Monocarp is the coach of the Berland State University programming teams. He decided to compose a problemset for a training session for his teams.Monocarp has nn problems that none of his students have seen yet. The ii-th problem has a topic aiai (an integer from 11 to nn) and a difficulty bibi (an integer from 11 to nn). All problems are different, that is, there are no two tasks that have the same topic and difficulty at the same time.Monocarp decided to select exactly 33 problems from nn problems for the problemset. The problems should satisfy at least one of two conditions (possibly, both):  the topics of all three selected problems are different;  the difficulties of all three selected problems are different. Your task is to determine the number of ways to select three problems for the problemset.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤500001≤t≤50000) — the number of testcases.The first line of each testcase contains an integer nn (3≤n≤2⋅1053≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of problems that Monocarp have.In the ii-th of the following nn lines, there are two integers aiai and bibi (1≤ai,bi≤n1≤ai,bi≤n) — the topic and the difficulty of the ii-th problem.It is guaranteed that there are no two problems that have the same topic and difficulty at the same time.The sum of nn over all testcases doesn't exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputPrint the number of ways to select three training problems that meet either of the requirements described in the statement.

NoteIn the first example, you can take the following sets of three problems:  problems 11, 22, 44;  problems 11, 33, 44;  problems 22, 33, 44. Thus, the number of ways is equal to three.

Marin wants you to count number of permutations that are beautiful. A beautiful permutation of length nn is a permutation that has the following property: gcd(1⋅p1,2⋅p2,…,n⋅pn)>1,gcd(1⋅p1,2⋅p2,…,n⋅pn)>1, where gcdgcd is the greatest common divisor.A permutation is an array consisting of nn distinct integers from 11 to nn in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4][2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2][1,2,2] is not a permutation (22 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4][1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3n=3 but there is 44 in the array).
InputThe first line contains one integer tt (1≤t≤1031≤t≤103) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing one integer nn (1≤n≤1031≤n≤103).
OutputFor each test case, print one integer — number of beautiful permutations. Because the answer can be very big, please print the answer modulo 998244353998244353.

NoteIn first test case, we only have one permutation which is [1][1] but it is not beautiful because gcd(1⋅1)=1gcd(1⋅1)=1.In second test case, we only have one beautiful permutation which is [2,1][2,1] because gcd(1⋅2,2⋅1)=2gcd(1⋅2,2⋅1)=2.

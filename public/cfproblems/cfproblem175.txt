Alice has a cake, and she is going to cut it. She will perform the following operation n−1n−1 times: choose a piece of the cake (initially, the cake is all one piece) with weight w≥2w≥2 and cut it into two smaller pieces of weight ⌊w2⌋⌊w2⌋ and ⌈w2⌉⌈w2⌉ (⌊x⌋⌊x⌋ and ⌈x⌉⌈x⌉ denote floor and ceiling functions, respectively).After cutting the cake in nn pieces, she will line up these nn pieces on a table in an arbitrary order. Let aiai be the weight of the ii-th piece in the line.You are given the array aa. Determine whether there exists an initial weight and sequence of operations which results in aa.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105).The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109).It is guaranteed that the sum of nn for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
OutputFor each test case, print a single line: print YES if the array aa could have resulted from Alice's operations, otherwise print NO.You may print each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all be recognized as positive answer).

NoteIn the first test case, it's possible to get the array aa by performing 00 operations on a cake with weight 327327.In the second test case, it's not possible to get the array aa.In the third test case, it's possible to get the array aa by performing 11 operation on a cake with weight 19704294731970429473:   Cut it in half, so that the weights are [985214736,985214737][985214736,985214737].  Note that the starting weight can be greater than 109109.In the fourth test case, it's possible to get the array aa by performing 22 operations on a cake with weight 66:  Cut it in half, so that the weights are [3,3][3,3].  Cut one of the two pieces with weight 33, so that the new weights are [1,2,3][1,2,3] which is equivalent to [2,3,1][2,3,1] up to reordering.

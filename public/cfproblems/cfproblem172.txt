You are given an integer nn and a string ss consisting of 2n2n lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The characters of the string ss are s0s1s2⋯s2n−1s0s1s2⋯s2n−1.A string tt of length 2n2n (whose characters are denoted by t0t1t2⋯t2n−1t0t1t2⋯t2n−1) is a xoration of ss if there exists an integer jj (0≤j≤2n−10≤j≤2n−1) such that, for each 0≤i≤2n−10≤i≤2n−1, ti=si⊕jti=si⊕j (where ⊕⊕ denotes the operation bitwise XOR).Find the lexicographically minimal xoration of ss.A string aa is lexicographically smaller than a string bb if and only if one of the following holds:   aa is a prefix of bb, but a≠ba≠b;  in the first position where aa and bb differ, the string aa has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in bb.  
InputThe first line contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤181≤n≤18).The second line contains a string ss consisting of 2n2n lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
OutputPrint a single line containing the lexicographically minimal xoration of ss.

NoteIn the first test, the lexicographically minimal xoration tt of s=s="acba" is "abca". It's a xoration because, for j=3j=3,   t0=s0⊕j=s3=t0=s0⊕j=s3= "a";  t1=s1⊕j=s2=t1=s1⊕j=s2= "b";  t2=s2⊕j=s1=t2=s2⊕j=s1= "c";  t3=s3⊕j=s0=t3=s3⊕j=s0= "a".  There isn't any xoration of ss lexicographically smaller than "abca".In the second test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing j=4j=4 in the definition of xoration.In the third test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing j=11j=11 in the definition of xoration.In the fourth test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing j=10j=10 in the definition of xoration.In the fifth test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing either j=0j=0 or j=1j=1 in the definition of xoration.

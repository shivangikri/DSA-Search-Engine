You are given three positive (greater than zero) integers cc, dd and xx. You have to find the number of pairs of positive integers (a,b)(a,b) such that equality c⋅lcm(a,b)−d⋅gcd(a,b)=xc⋅lcm(a,b)−d⋅gcd(a,b)=x holds. Where lcm(a,b)lcm(a,b) is the least common multiple of aa and bb and gcd(a,b)gcd(a,b) is the greatest common divisor of aa and bb.
InputThe first line contains one integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing three integer cc, dd and xx (1≤c,d,x≤1071≤c,d,x≤107).
OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the number of pairs (a,ba,b) such that the above equality holds.

You are given nn elements numbered from 11 to nn, the element ii has value aiai and color cici, initially, ci=0ci=0 for all ii.The following operation can be applied:  Select three elements ii, jj and kk (1≤i<j<k≤n1≤i<j<k≤n), such that cici, cjcj and ckck are all equal to 00 and ai=akai=ak, then set cj=1cj=1. Find the maximum value of ∑i=1nci∑i=1nci that can be obtained after applying the given operation any number of times.
InputThe first line contains an integer nn (3≤n≤2⋅1053≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of elements.The second line consists of nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n), where aiai is the value of the ii-th element.
OutputPrint a single integer in a line — the maximum value of ∑i=1nci∑i=1nci that can be obtained after applying the given operation any number of times.

There is an infinite set generated as follows:  11 is in this set.  If xx is in this set, x⋅ax⋅a and x+bx+b both are in this set. For example, when a=3a=3 and b=6b=6, the five smallest elements of the set are:  11,  33 (11 is in this set, so 1⋅a=31⋅a=3 is in this set),  77 (11 is in this set, so 1+b=71+b=7 is in this set),  99 (33 is in this set, so 3⋅a=93⋅a=9 is in this set),  1313 (77 is in this set, so 7+b=137+b=13 is in this set). Given positive integers aa, bb, nn, determine if nn is in this set.
InputThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer tt (1≤t≤1051≤t≤105) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line describing each test case contains three integers nn, aa, bb (1≤n,a,b≤1091≤n,a,b≤109) separated by a single space.
OutputFor each test case, print "Yes" if nn is in this set, and "No" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.

NoteIn the first test case, 2424 is generated as follows:  11 is in this set, so 33 and 66 are in this set;  33 is in this set, so 99 and 88 are in this set;  88 is in this set, so 2424 and 1313 are in this set. Thus we can see 2424 is in this set.The five smallest elements of the set in the second test case is described in statements. We can see that 1010 isn't among them.

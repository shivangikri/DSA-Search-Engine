Now you get Baby Ehab's first words: "Given an integer nn, find the longest subsequence of [1,2,…,n−1][1,2,…,n−1] whose product is 11 modulo nn." Please solve the problem.A sequence bb is a subsequence of an array aa if bb can be obtained from aa by deleting some (possibly all) elements. The product of an empty subsequence is equal to 11.
InputThe only line contains the integer nn (2≤n≤1052≤n≤105).
OutputThe first line should contain a single integer, the length of the longest subsequence.The second line should contain the elements of the subsequence, in increasing order.If there are multiple solutions, you can print any.

NoteIn the first example, the product of the elements is 66 which is congruent to 11 modulo 55. The only longer subsequence is [1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4]. Its product is 2424 which is congruent to 44 modulo 55. Hence, the answer is [1,2,3][1,2,3].

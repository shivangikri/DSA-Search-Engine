You have an array of integers aa of size nn. Initially, all elements of the array are equal to 11. You can perform the following operation: choose two integers ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n) and xx (x>0x>0), and then increase the value of aiai by ⌊aix⌋⌊aix⌋ (i.e. make ai=ai+⌊aix⌋ai=ai+⌊aix⌋).After performing all operations, you will receive cici coins for all such ii that ai=biai=bi.Your task is to determine the maximum number of coins that you can receive by performing no more than kk operations.
InputThe first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and kk (1≤n≤103;0≤k≤1061≤n≤103;0≤k≤106) — the size of the array and the maximum number of operations, respectively.The second line contains nn integers b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤1031≤bi≤103).The third line contains nn integers c1,c2,…,cnc1,c2,…,cn (1≤ci≤1061≤ci≤106).The sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 103103.
OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of coins that you can get by performing no more than kk operations.
